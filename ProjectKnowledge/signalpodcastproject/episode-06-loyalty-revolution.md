## Guest Introduction (John)

“Today we’re joined by Tyler Jacobs, Director of Digital Transformation at Morey’s Piers.

Tyler first joined Morey’s as an intern over a decade ago, and since then he’s become the person leadership turns to when they need to bridge legacy operations with modern technology.

Most recently, Tyler and his team launched Fam Club — Morey’s first-ever loyalty program. In just four months, with a team of three, they integrated multiple systems, cleaned years of guest data, and rolled out a points-based program that delivers real-time offers as soon as a guest steps off a ride.

What makes this story remarkable is that Morey’s has always been known for its “no discount” philosophy. Loyalty at Morey’s isn’t about coupons — it’s about creating value, nudging behavior, and getting guests to do just one more thing.

I'm excited to dive into how Tyler and the Morey's team pulled this off, so Tyler, welcome to Signal."

## Part 1: The Foundation (15-20 minutes)

**John**: "Let's address the elephant in the room first. Tim and Tyler, you two have known each other for years - Tyler started as an intern under Tim at Morey's, and you still talk almost daily even though it's been a few years since Tim's been away from Morey's. How does that relationship work, and why are we having this conversation together?"

**John**: "Tyler, loyalty programs have been talked about at Morey's for years. What made now the right moment to finally make it happen?"

**Tim**: "Launching Fam Club in just four months with a small team of only three people is unusual. What were the biggest challenges in pulling it off so quickly?"

**John**: "Before we get into the program itself, what problem were you really trying to solve?"

## Part 2: Building the Fam Club (12-15 minutes)

**Tim**: “You’ve said the hardest part wasn’t the perks, it was the data. What was broken, and how did you fix it enough to make this program possible?”

**John**: “Morey’s has a strong no-discount culture. How did you design a program that respected that history while still giving guests compelling reasons to engage?”

**Tim**: “Integrating multiple systems that weren’t built to talk to each other sounds like a nightmare. How did your team make it work?”

**John**: "Let's talk about the guest experience. From the guest’s point of view, what feels different now about visiting Morey’s compared to before Fam Club launched?”

## Part 3: Impact & What's Next (12-15 minutes)

**John**: "You're in a hyper-competitive boardwalk environment - dozens of food stands and shops on the boardwalk. How do you use loyalty to keep spending inside the park when there's a cheaper option 50 feet away?"

**Tim**: "You've talked about retention skyrocketing when passholders visit just two more times per year. How do you plan to use Fam Club to specifically target that behavior?"

**John**: "What's been the biggest surprise so far since launch — either from guest feedback or operational reality?"

**Tim**: "Was there a moment during implementation when everything was going wrong? What was your lowest point, and how did you push through?"

**John**: "Now that it's live, what's the weirdest or most unexpected guest behavior you've discovered through the data?"

**Tim**: "Looking ahead, how do you see Fam Club evolving over the next couple of years?"


## Lightning Round (Rapid-Fire Questions)

**Tim**: "Points or discounts?"

**John**: "Biggest loyalty program mistake you see others make?"

**Tim**: "Mobile app or SMS?"

**John**: "Best guest reaction you've gotten so far?"

**Tim**: "Most overrated loyalty program feature?"

**John**: "Scan cards or mobile-only?"

**Tim**: "Retention or acquisition?"

**John**: "Data privacy – worry or overblown?"

**Tim**: "Next feature you're building?"

## Closing Question

**John**: "Tyler, you proved that a small, scrappy team can deliver enterprise-level innovation. For operators listening who think loyalty requires big budgets or giant tech teams, what’s your message?”

**Themes we explored today:**
1. Why loyalty is about behavior change, not discounts
2. How small teams can pull off major digital transformation projects
3. The operational challenges of integrating legacy systems
4. Retention as the ultimate KPI   
5. Competitive lessons from the boardwalk environment
