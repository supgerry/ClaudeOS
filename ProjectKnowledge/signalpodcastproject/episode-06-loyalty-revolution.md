- Operating in highly competitive Wildwood boardwalk environment (dense F&B competition)

- Strategic philosophy: avoid discounts, instead offer value-driven incentives

## **Part 1: Origins & Relationship History (10–12 minutes)**

  

**John**: “Tyler, you’ve known Tim since your intern days at Morey’s. Take us back — what were those early projects like, and how did that relationship shape the way you collaborate today?”

  

**Tim**: “We’ve been debating ideas almost daily for years. From your perspective, what’s been the most valuable part of having that sounding board inside the company?”

  

**John**: “The idea of a loyalty program at Morey’s has been around for decades, long before the tech was ready. What finally made _this_ the moment to build it?”

---

## **Part 2: Building Loyalty in a Legacy Environment (12–15 minutes)**

  

**Tim**: “Morey’s is a legacy park with 50+ years of history. How did you balance respect for tradition with pushing through the kind of digital transformation a program like this required?”

  

**John**: “You mentioned the hardest part was the data. What does ‘bad data’ actually look like in practice, and how did you approach cleaning it up enough to make a loyalty program possible?”

  

**Tim** _(Ops focus)_: “Walk us through the mechanics — you had multiple systems that didn’t talk to each other. How did a three-person team force them to integrate?”

  

**John** _(Tech/strategy focus)_: “You’ve said this wasn’t about discounts, but about offers and creating value. Why was that distinction important for Morey’s culture?”

---

## **Part 3: The Guest Behavior Engine (12–15 minutes)**

  

**John**: “You’ve described this almost like creating a new currency — guests scan into a ride and by the time they exit, they’ve got a personalized offer in their pocket. How do you see this changing guest behavior at scale?”

  

**Tim**: “Retention is a big metric for you. If a passholder visits two extra times, retention skyrockets. How are you designing the program to nudge toward those extra visits?”

  

**John**: “You’re competing with dozens of food stands and shops just steps away. How do you use loyalty to get guests to eat, shop, and spend with Morey’s instead of across the boardwalk?”

  

**Tim**: “What’s been the biggest surprise so far — either from guest response or operational complexity — since Fam Club launched?”

---

## **Part 4: Lessons Learned & What’s Next (12–15 minutes)**

  

**John**: “You built and launched this in four months with limited resources. For other operators listening, what’s the key lesson about doing big things fast without a massive budget?”

  

**Tim**: “Rolling out anything new has its bumps. What were the good, bad, and ugly moments you learned from this first season?”

  

**John**: “How do you see loyalty evolving at Morey’s in the next couple of years? What’s the next frontier once the foundation is in place?”

  

**Tim**: “If you could go back and give yourself one piece of advice before starting the project, what would it be?”

---

## **Behind the Scenes Segment (5–7 minutes)**

  

**Tim**: “Tell us about the small team that pulled this off. What made it possible for three people to do what many would assume takes dozens?”

  

**John**: “Vendors and third parties were part of the process. Without naming names, what did you learn about managing external partners when you’re moving this fast?”

---

## **Lightning Round (Rapid Fire)**

- **John**: “Points-based or perks-based — which works better for attractions?”
    
- **Tim**: “Discount or added value — what do guests respond to more?”
    
- **John**: “Most underrated data point you now track?”
    
- **Tim**: “One loyalty program outside attractions you admire?”
    
- **John**: “If you had to scrap _Fam Club_ tomorrow, what’s the one part you’d fight to keep?”
