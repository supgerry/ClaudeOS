## Guest Introduction (John)


"Today we're joined by Tyler Jacobs from Morey's Piers, and Tyler here represents something pretty cool in our industry. He's what happens when someone grows up in operations and becomes the person leadership calls when they need to figure out how to actually make things work.

Tyler and his team just launched Morey's new Fam Club loyalty program this summer – a points-based system that had to integrate multiple disconnected systems, deliver real-time messaging, and somehow do it all with a three-person team where one of them – Tyler – freely admits he can't write a line of code.

What makes this story fascinating for our audience is that Morey's has a long-standing 'no discount' culture. They've never believed in devaluing their product. But they knew they needed a way to extend strategic offers, drive retention, and get guests to do 'one more thing' – ride one more ride, eat one more meal, visit one more time.

The result is a loyalty program that sends you a targeted message by the time you get off a ride, offering you something specific at the stand right at the exit. That's the kind of real-time, behavior-driven marketing that most attractions dream about but few actually execute. I'm excited to dive into how Tyler and the Morey's team pulled this off. 

Tyler, welcome to Signal."

## Part 1: The Foundation (15-20 minutes)

**John**: "Let's address the elephant in the room first. Tim and Tyler, you two have known each other for years - Tyler started as an intern under Tim at Morey's, and you still talk almost daily even though Tim's been at RocketRez since last year. How does that relationship work, and why are we having this conversation together?"

**Tim**: "Tyler, take me back to when you started at Morey's as an intern. What was your initial impression of how things worked there, and what made you want to stay?"

**John**: "Tyler, you said Morey's has never believed in discounting – it's not in your DNA. - What made now the right moment to finally make it happen?”

**Tim**: "Tyler, walk me through the moment when you realized you could create a 'currency' instead of discounts. What was the mental shift there?"

**John**: "You're competing on a mile-long boardwalk with countless pizza shops and t-shirt stores, often at lower prices. How does a points-based loyalty program help you win that battle?"

---

## Part 2: The Technical Challenge (15-20 minutes)

**Tim**: "Tyler, you mentioned you had to force multiple systems to talk to each other that were never designed to integrate. Walk us through what that actually looked like day-to-day."

**John**: "You accomplished this with a three-person team in four months, and Tyler, you freely admit you can't code. How do you manage a technical project when you're not technical yourself?"

**Tim**: "Tyler, you mentioned working with third-party vendors who 'didn't want to do it either.' How do you get external partners to buy into your timeline when they have their own priorities?"

**John**: "Let's talk about the guest experience. Tyler, explain how a guest goes from getting on a ride to receiving a targeted offer by the time they get off."

**Tim**: "You scan at every ride instead of having a main gate entry. That's a big operational decision. What drove that choice, and how does it change the guest flow?"

---

## Part 3: The Results & Future (15-20 minutes)

**John**: "You mentioned you can track retention rates and know that they jump 13-15% if season pass holders visit two more times than average. How does the loyalty program specifically target that behavior?"

**Tim**: "Tyler, you mentioned in the pre-call there were 'a lot of people arguing' during implementation. Without naming names, what were the biggest internal resistance points?"

**John**: "You forced yourselves into a very short timeline – February decision to July launch. Looking back, what would you do differently?"

**Tyler**: "You're gathering unprecedented data about guest behavior. What insights have surprised you so far about how people actually move through your attraction?"

**Tim**: "This program integrates season passes, promos, and entitlements. Tyler, do you see this eventually replacing traditional season pass structures, or enhancing them?"

---

## Behind the Scenes Segment (5-7 minutes)

**Tim**: "Tyler, tell us about a moment during implementation when everything was going wrong. What was your lowest point, and how did you push through?"

**John**: "And Tim, there had to be moments where you questioned whether Tyler could actually pull this off. What kept you confident in the project?"

**Tyler**: "Now that it's live, what's the weirdest or most unexpected guest behavior you've discovered through the data?"

---

## Lightning Round (Rapid-Fire Questions)

**Tim**: "Points or discounts?"

**Tyler**: "Season passes – asset or headache?"

**Tim**: "Biggest loyalty program mistake you see others make?"

**Tyler**: "Real-time offers or batch campaigns?"

**Tim**: "Mobile app or SMS?"

**Tyler**: "Best guest reaction you've gotten so far?"

**Tim**: "Most overrated loyalty program feature?"

**Tyler**: "Scan cards or mobile-only?"

**Tim**: "Retention or acquisition?"

**Tyler**: "Data privacy – worry or overblown?"

**Tim**: "Next feature you're building?"

**Tyler**: "Advice for operators considering loyalty programs?"

---

## Closing Segment

**John**: "Tyler, you've proven that a small team can build sophisticated guest engagement systems. For operators listening who think they need massive resources or technical teams, what's your message?"

**Tim**: "And Tyler, looking ahead to next season, what are you most excited to test or improve?"

**Tyler**: "Tim, from your perspective watching this project from both the vendor and mentor side, what's the biggest lesson for the industry?"

**John**: "Finally, Tyler, if operators could implement just one element of what you've built, what would have the biggest impact on their business?"

**Themes we explored today:**

1. How authentic relationships drive innovation in our industry
2. Why loyalty programs need to align with company culture, not fight it
3. The power of real-time behavioral data in driving guest engagement
4. How small teams can execute big technical projects with the right approach
5. The evolution from discounting to value creation through strategic offers
