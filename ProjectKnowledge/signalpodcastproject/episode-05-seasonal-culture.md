## Guest Introduction (for Tim to read)


"Today we're joined by Shaun McKeogh, one of the most respected voices in our industry when it comes to culture, engagement, and leadership in a seasonal world. If you’ve ever been to an IAAPA conference in the past decade, you’ve probably seen Shaun in action — leading workshops on culture and engagement, mentoring the next generation of leaders, or helping operators design better training systems.

Shaun’s career began in Australia’s biggest theme parks and eventually took him across the globe, from helping launch Ferrari World Abu Dhabi to leading operations at Bangkok's King Power Mahanakhon. From those early days, he learned something essential: you can’t just hope culture happens. You have to architect it.

Today, he runs Attractions Academy, where he helps operators solve what might be the industry's biggest paradox: how do you build lasting company culture when half your workforce changes every six months?

What makes Shaun's perspective so valuable is simple: while attractions run on rides, tech, and infrastructure, he reminds us that it's people who deliver the magic. And in a world where seasonal turnover is the norm, Shaun has figured out how to create the systems and culture that maintain service excellence despite constant workforce changes.

Shaun, welcome to Signal."

## Part 1: From Clown to Consultant – Origins (8–10 minutes)

**John**: "Shaun, you've worn many hats in this industry — even literally, as a clown early in your career. How did those front-line experiences shape the leader and trainer you are today?"

**Tim**: "You worked on the Ferrari World opening team where you built culture from scratch with a brand new workforce. Walk us through that process – how do you create (or architect) culture when you're starting with zero?"

---

## Part 2: The Seasonal Culture Paradox (8–10 minutes)

**Tim**: "Let's tackle the elephant in the room – attractions need consistent culture and service quality, but rely on seasonal workers who might only be with you for three to six months. What's the fundamental mistake most operators make when approaching this paradox?"

**John**: "From a business strategy perspective, how do you measure the ROI of culture-building when your workforce is constantly changing? What metrics actually matter when half your team turns over every season?"

**Tim**: "You mentioned that you get frustrated when operators think they do training but really just run a 20-minute annual workshop. With seasonal workers, how do you compress effective culture building into potentially just a few months without sacrificing depth?"

**John**: "You often say organizations succeed when they treat employees as true stakeholders. How does that philosophy change when dealing with temporary seasonal workers versus year-round staff?"

---

## Part 3: Engagement is Strategy, Not Fluff (8–10 minutes)

**Tim**: “What’s the biggest misconception about HR and engagement that you wish leaders would finally drop?”

**John**: “You’ve said employee engagement isn’t about warm fuzzies — it’s about strategy and standards. What does that mean in practice for operators?”

**Tim**: "You talked about the importance of having documentation and strategic roadmaps, not just hoping culture happens. For seasonal operations where you're constantly onboarding new people, what does that documentation actually look like?"

**John**: "You mentioned that many leadership teams don't give HR a 'seat at the table' — they're making business decisions without considering the people impact. How do you convince leadership that workforce strategy needs to be part of business strategy, especially with seasonal challenges?"

---

## Part 4: Training as Non-Negotiable Infrastructure (8–10 minutes)

**Tim**: "You're famous for saying 'Don't cut the training budget' even in tough times. With seasonal workers, make the business case – how do you justify training investment to a CFO when half your staff will be gone in six months?"

**John**: "Through IAAPA, you've helped groom the next generation of leaders. What gaps do you see in how our industry develops managers specifically for seasonal workforce management?"

**Tim**: “You know front-line reality from having worked in it. How do you coach seasonal staff to deliver genuine joy in jobs that aren’t always glamorous or well-paid?”

---

## Part 5: Safety Culture vs. Compliance & Modern Workforce (8–10 minutes)

**Tim**: "You talked about government agencies helping businesses develop a 'safety first culture' versus just bringing in standards. In seasonal operations where you're constantly training new people on safety, how do you build that culture versus just checking compliance boxes?"

**John**: "Post-COVID, you urged leaders to over-communicate and keep teams engaged virtually. What did that crisis teach you about culture resilience?”

**Tim**: "For operators struggling with seasonal labor shortages, what's the one thing they can do to become an employer people want to come back to year after year?"

---

## Part 6: The Spirit of the Organization (8–10 minutes)

**John**: "When you think about operational excellence, you often say, 'We're in the business of fun, but we achieve it through smart systems.' What systems behind the scenes matter most for guest experience?”

**Tim**: "You've talked about the 'spirit of the organization' — that guests can feel when a culture is authentic. With constantly changing seasonal teams, how do you maintain that consistent spirit that guests experience? Can you share an example where you saw that spirit come alive?”"

**John**: "You mentioned that engaged employees lead to better guest experiences. With seasonal teams, how do you measure and maintain that engagement throughout their short tenure?"

---

## Behind the Scenes Segment (5–7 minutes)

**Tim**: "You've traveled and worked across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and beyond. What's one cultural or operational practice you've seen abroad that you wish more Western operators would adopt, especially for seasonal workforce management?"

**John**: "On the flip side, what's a leadership or training approach from Western parks that you think could benefit operators in Asia-Pacific when dealing with seasonal teams?"

**Tim**: "Tell us about a time when you saw a seasonal culture strategy completely backfire. What went wrong, and what did it teach you?"


---

## Lightning Round (Rapid-Fire Questions)


**John**: “Best attraction you’ve ever visited purely for fun?”

**Tim**: "Hire for attitude or hire for experience?"

**John**: "Most overrated training exercise?"

**Tim**: "Biggest seasonal hiring mistake you see?"

**John**: "Cross-training seasonal staff – essential or nice-to-have?"

**Tim**: "Best way to retain seasonal workers year over year?"

**John**: "Most underutilized tool for building culture?"

**Tim**: "Best way to recognize seasonal employees?"

**John**: “One leadership quality every future GM should have?”



---

## Closing Segment

**Tim**: "Shaun, you've built your career on helping people deliver the magic in a seasonal world. For operators listening who are planning their 2026 seasonal hiring right now, what's the one thing they should start doing differently next week?"

**John**: "Looking ahead, what qualities do you think the next generation of attraction leaders will need most when managing seasonal teams — and how do we cultivate them now?"

**Tim**: "And finally, if you could leave one message with every leader in our industry about building culture in a seasonal world, what would it be?"

**Themes we explored today:**

1. Why culture can't be an accident in seasonal operations
2. How training investment pays off even with high turnover
3. Leadership strategies that work across cultural differences
4. Post-COVID changes in seasonal workforce expectations
5. Building resilient organizational spirit that survives constant change
