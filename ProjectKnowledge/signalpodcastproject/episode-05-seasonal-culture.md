# Episode 5: Culture in a Seasonal World

## Episode Overview

**Description**: How do you build lasting company culture when half your workforce changes every six months? John & Tim explore the unique challenges of managing seasonal teams.

## Core Challenge

### The Seasonal Paradox
Attractions need consistent culture and service quality, but rely heavily on temporary seasonal workers who may only be with the company for 3-6 months. This creates unique challenges in:
- Training and onboarding efficiency
- Culture transmission and reinforcement
- Leadership development and succession planning
- Year-round team motivation and engagement

## Key Discussion Areas

### Culture Design for Seasonal Operations

- Creating systems that maintain culture continuity
- Balancing flexibility with consistency

### Leadership in Seasonal Environments
- Developing seasonal supervisors and managers

- Cross-training for operational continuity
- Managing performance across different employment types

### Retention and Alumni Strategies

2. **How do you create rapid cultural integration without sacrificing authenticity or depth?**
3. **What systems and processes can maintain culture when leadership and staff are constantly changing?**
