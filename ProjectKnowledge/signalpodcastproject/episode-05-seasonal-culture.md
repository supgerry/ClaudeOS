## Guest Introduction (for Tim to read)

"Today we're joined by Shaun McKeogh, and if you've been to an IAAPA conference in the past decade, you've probably seen Shaun in action – whether he's moderating a panel on building winning teams, leading a diversity and inclusion workshop, or mentoring the next generation of attraction leaders through the IAAPA Institute for Attraction Managers.

But here's what makes Shaun's perspective so valuable: he's lived this industry from every angle. His career literally started as a clown – yes, an actual clown – at Australian theme parks, which gave him firsthand experience in the challenge every attraction faces: how do you maintain authentic joy and energy when you're dealing with the realities of seasonal employment, budget pressures, and the expectation that your team delivers 'perfect, genuine, blissful, smiling joy' to thousands of guests every day?

From those front-line beginnings, Shaun worked his way up through operations at Warner Bros. Movie World and Sea World, then became part of the opening leadership team at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi – one of the most successful theme park launches in recent memory. That experience taught him something crucial: you can't just hope culture happens. You have to architect it from day one.

Today, through Attractions Academy, Shaun helps operators worldwide solve what might be the industry's biggest paradox: how do you build lasting company culture when half your workforce changes every six months? How do you create the systems and training that maintain service excellence when your team is constantly turning over?

Shaun just received IAAPA's 2024-2025 Service Award for Asia-Pacific, recognizing his contributions as a mentor and educator. But what I think our listeners will find most valuable is his no-nonsense approach to the people side of our business. He's famous for saying 'Don't cut the training budget' even when times get tough, and he'll tell you exactly why that's not just good HR advice – it's smart business strategy.

Shaun, welcome to Signal. Let's talk about building culture in a world where your team changes with the seasons."

## Part 1: The Seasonal Culture Paradox (8-10 minutes)

### Opening Questions

**Tim**: "Shaun, you've seen this challenge everywhere from Australia to the Middle East to Asia – attractions need consistent culture and service quality, but rely heavily on seasonal workers who might only be with you for three to six months. What's the fundamental mistake most operators make when approaching this paradox?"

**John**: "From a business strategy perspective, how do you measure the ROI of culture-building when your workforce is constantly changing? What metrics actually matter?"

**Tim** _(Operational Focus)_: "Let's get practical. You worked on the Ferrari World opening team where you built culture from scratch with a brand new workforce. Walk us through that process – how do you architect culture when you're starting with zero people and zero precedent?"

**John** _(Strategic Business)_: "You often say organizations succeed when they treat employees as true stakeholders. How does that philosophy change when dealing with temporary seasonal workers versus year-round staff?"

---

## Part 2: Training as Non-Negotiable Infrastructure (8-10 minutes)

### Core Questions

**John** _(Business Investment)_: "You're famous for saying 'Don't cut the training budget' even during tough times. Make the business case – how do you justify training investment to a CFO when half your staff will be gone in six months?"

**Tim** _(Implementation Reality)_: "You mentioned that research shows the first 90 days are critical for new employees. But seasonal workers might only be with you for 90 days total. How do you compress effective onboarding without sacrificing quality?"

**Tim** _(Front-line Experience)_: "You started as a clown – literally – so you understand the front-line reality. How do you train seasonal staff to maintain that 'perfect, genuine, blissful, smiling joy' when the job itself might not be glamorous or well-paid?"

**John** _(Scalability Focus)_: "Through the IAAPA Institute, you're training the next generation of attraction managers. What's the biggest gap you see between what new managers think they need to know about seasonal workforce management versus what actually works?"

---

## Part 3: Leadership in Crisis and Recovery (8-10 minutes)

### Strategic Questions

**Tim** _(Crisis Management)_: "During COVID, you urged leaders to over-communicate and keep furloughed teams engaged through virtual training and check-ins. What did that crisis teach you about maintaining culture when your team isn't even physically present?"

**John** _(Post-COVID Strategy)_: "Post-pandemic, employee expectations have shifted dramatically. How has that changed the way attractions need to approach seasonal hiring and retention? What do today's seasonal workers want that they didn't before?"

**John** _(Technology Integration)_: "You mentioned using online training to keep furloughed teams engaged. How has technology changed your approach to training seasonal workers? What tools should operators be investing in?"

**Tim** _(Cultural Resilience)_: "You talk about building 'the spirit of an organization.' How do you build a spirit that's resilient enough to survive when 50% of your team turns over every year?"

---

## Part 4: Diversity, Inclusion, and Global Perspectives (8-10 minutes)

### Leadership Questions

**Tim** _(Cultural Intelligence)_: "You've organized diversity and inclusion workshops for IAAPA and worked across Australia, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. How do cultural differences impact the way you build team culture in different regions?"

**John** _(Competitive Advantage)_: "You argue that diverse teams bring creative strengths to guest experience. In a seasonal environment where you're hiring quickly and in volume, how do you maintain focus on diversity without sacrificing speed?"

**John** _(Business Impact)_: "From a strategic standpoint, how does building an inclusive culture translate to better business outcomes, especially when dealing with seasonal operations?"

**Tim** _(Practical Implementation)_: "You've worked in markets where seasonal labor might come from different cultural backgrounds than your year-round staff. How do you bridge those cultural differences to create unified team culture?"

---

## Behind the Scenes Segment (5-7 minutes)

### Operational Reality

**Tim** _(Real-World Examples)_: "Tell us about a time when you saw a seasonal culture strategy completely backfire. What went wrong, and what did it teach you?"

**John** _(Success Stories)_: "On the flip side, share an example where investing in seasonal workforce culture paid off in measurable ways. What were the results?"

**Tim** _(Personal Philosophy)_: "You mentioned that we're in the business of fun, but we achieve it through smart systems. What does that mean practically for seasonal workforce management?"

---

## Lightning Round (Rapid-Fire Questions)

**Tim**: "Hire for attitude or hire for experience?"

**John**: "Most overrated employee engagement strategy?"

**Tim**: "Biggest seasonal hiring mistake you see?"

**John**: "Training budget as percentage of revenue – what's your target?"

**Tim**: "Best way to retain seasonal workers year over year?"

**John**: "Most underutilized tool for building culture?"

**Tim**: "Disney or Universal – who does seasonal culture better?"

**John**: "Exit interviews with seasonal staff – worth it or waste of time?"

**Tim**: "Group interviews or individual interviews for seasonal hiring?"

**John**: "Most important leadership quality for managing seasonal teams?"

**Tim**: "Best recognition program for seasonal workers?"

**John**: "Cross-training seasonal staff – essential or nice-to-have?"

**Tim**: "Biggest culture killer in seasonal operations?"

**John**: "Performance reviews for 3-month employees – yes or no?"

**Tim**: "Most effective way to onboard 50 people in one week?"

## Closing Segment

**John** _(Strategic Wrap-up)_: "Shaun, you're now mentoring the next generation of attraction leaders through IAAPA. What's the one mindset shift you want them to have about seasonal workforce management?"

**Tim** _(Practical Takeaway)_: "For operators listening who are planning their 2026 seasonal hiring right now, what's the one thing they should start doing differently this week?"

**John** _(Future Vision)_: "Looking ahead, how do you see seasonal workforce management evolving? What should operators start preparing for now?"

**Tim** _(Personal Reflection)_: "From clown to consultant to IAAPA Service Award recipient – that's quite a journey. What would you tell that young clown just starting out about the career path ahead?"

**Themes we explored today:**

1. Why culture can't be an accident in seasonal operations
2. How training investment pays off even with high turnover
3. Leadership strategies that work across cultural differences
4. Post-COVID changes in seasonal workforce expectations
5. Building resilient organizational spirit that survives constant change
