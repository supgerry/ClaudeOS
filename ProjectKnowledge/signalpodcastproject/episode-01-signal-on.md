# Episode 1: Signal On - State of the Attractions Industry

## Episode Brief

**Working Title**: Signal On: State of the Attractions Industry
**Episode Type**: Host-Only
**Target Record Date**: Wednesday, June 18, 2025

## The Core Message

### Episode Goal
To introduce John and Tim as credible, engaging hosts with distinct and valuable perspectives, and to establish the podcast's mission as an essential resource for operators who want honest, authentic insights.

### Who is this for?
Leaders at enterprise-level attractions who are tired of superficial advice and are looking for strategic insights from people who have lived this business from every angle.

### The Listener Takeaway
This isn't just another industry podcast. John and Tim have lived this business from every angle—from ride operator to CEO, from the front lines to the board room—and they're going to share what actually matters, including their failures and hard-won lessons.

## Script Flow

### A. Opening Segments (0-5 minutes)

#### Cold Open Hook (30-60 seconds)
*Producer's Note: We'll pull a quote from the "Real Talk" or vulnerability segments for this.*

#### Signal Intro (1-2 minutes)
- John and Tim introduce themselves and RocketRez's mission
- Brief explanation of why they're starting this podcast now
- Set expectations for what listeners will get from "Signal"

**John's Opening Line (Suggestion)**: "Welcome to Signal, the podcast for attractions operators who want to look around the corner. I'm John."

**Tim's Follow-up (Suggestion)**: "And I'm Tim. We're here because we think it's time for a different kind of conversation about what's really happening in our industry."

#### Industry Pulse (2-3 minutes)
- Focus on why John and Tim decided to start this podcast
- Personal anecdotes about recent conversations with operators
- Set up the topics they want to tackle in future episodes

*Producer's Prompt*: "Let's start with the why. John, Tim - what made you both decide this was the right time to start having these conversations publicly?"

### B. Main Content: Host-Only Format (5-50 minutes)

#### The Setup (3-5 minutes)
- Current challenges operators are facing with data understanding
- The shift from "we have so much data, we don't know what to do with it" to "I'm gonna try to figure this out, but I don't know where to start"
- Operators taking calculated risks with limited budgets to understand their business
- The "money ball" approach to attractions operations

*Producer's Research Note*: Focus on the data understanding challenge - operators are moving from being overwhelmed by data to trying to figure out where to start, like gambling with calculated risks on what areas of their business to analyze first.

#### Four Key Questions (35-40 minutes)

1. **Question 1: Who are you and why should we listen?** (8-10 minutes)
   - **For Tim**: "Tim, you started as a ride operator and spent 20 years at Morey's Piers. You often mention your mentor, Jack Morey, and his 'Jack-isms'. Can you share one that still guides how you see the attractions world today?"
   - **For John**: "John, you came at this from a different angle, building RocketRez from the ground up as a solo entrepreneur. What was the specific, nagging problem you saw in the market that made you dedicate your career to fixing it?"

2. **Question 2: Let's get vulnerable - where have you failed?** (8-10 minutes)
   - **For both**: "Where have you failed and what's been one of the biggest learnings of your career?"
   - Follow-up: "How does that failure inform how you approach problems in the industry today?"

3. **Question 3: What is the biggest blind spot for operators today?** (8-10 minutes)
   - **For John**: "From a tech and data perspective, where are operators leaving money on the table or missing a huge opportunity?"
   - **For Tim**: "From your experience on the ground, what's a non-technical, operational habit or mindset that you see holding even the best attractions back?"

4. **Question 4: What is the 'Signal' we should be listening for?** (8-10 minutes)
   - **For both**: "Looking ahead, if you had to advise operators to tune out all the noise and focus on one critical 'signal' for success in the next 18-24 months, what would it be?"

#### Real Talk (5-7 minutes)
*Producer's Prompt*: "Okay, let's get candid. What is a common piece of industry advice you hear all the time that you fundamentally disagree with?"

### C. Closing Segments (50-60 minutes)

#### Future Episodes Preview (2-3 minutes)
- Preview the topics they want to tackle in upcoming episodes
- Connect back to the data understanding challenge and other themes mentioned

*Producer's Prompt*: "We've covered a lot of ground about who you are and what you're seeing. Give our listeners a preview - what are some of the specific topics you want to dive deep into in future episodes?"

#### Key Takeaways (2-3 minutes)
*Producer's Prompt for Hosts*: "Let's boil it down. What's the one thought you want to leave our listeners with about what this podcast is going to be?"

#### Signal Out (1-2 minutes)
*Script Cue*: Thank the audience and **tease Episode 2**: "Be sure to join us next time when we talk with **Denise Beckson of Morey's Piers**, a key voice in industry lobbying, about the complex and urgent topic of cross-border tourism and the J1 visa program. You won't want to miss it."
