## name: podcast-clip-captions description: Create engaging LinkedIn and YouTube titles with captions for short podcast video clips (under 1:30). Use when generating promotional copy for Signal podcast clips, including video titles, LinkedIn captions, and YouTube descriptions. Triggers on requests to write clip titles, social captions, or promotional copy for podcast video snippets.

# Podcast Clip Captions

Generate scroll-stopping titles and captions for short podcast video clips that match Signal's brand voice.

## Required Inputs

1. **Transcript** of the video clip
2. **Episode context** (guest name, title, company, episode topic, episode link)
3. **Target platforms** (LinkedIn, YouTube, or both)

## Output Format

For each clip, produce:

```
## Video Title
[6-12 word title that captures the hook]

## LinkedIn Caption
[1-2 line caption with emoji, ending with engagement prompt or call-to-action]

Ft. [Guest Name]—[Title] at [Company].

Full episode on Youtube: [YouTube link]
Or listen on your favourite podcast platform: [Episode page link]

## YouTube Caption
[1-line caption, slightly adapted for YouTube's context]

Full episode: [YouTube link]
```

## Process

1. **Identify the hook**: Find the most engaging insight, counterintuitive claim, or actionable takeaway
2. **Extract the core tension**: What problem is being solved? What assumption is being challenged?
3. **Write the title**: Make it specific and benefit-driven, not generic
4. **Craft the caption**: Spark curiosity, invite engagement, ground it in what was said

## Signal Brand Voice

- **Professional yet approachable**: Expert insights without jargon
- **Curiosity-driven**: Lead with questions or surprising insights
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what operators can learn or do
- **Authentic**: Ground copy in actual transcript content—never invent claims

## Title Guidelines

**Do:**

- Use 6-12 words
- Lead with the hook or transformation
- Include specific details when impactful (names, metrics, frameworks)
- Use title case

**Don't:**

- Be vague or generic ("Great Advice on Leadership")
- Use clickbait that doesn't match content
- Exceed 12 words

**Strong patterns:**

- "How [Company] [Achieved Result]"
- "Why [Common Belief] [Is Wrong/Incomplete]"
- "[Framework/Concept]: [Specific Application]"
- "The [Metric/Approach] That [Changed Outcome]"

## Caption Guidelines

**LinkedIn:**

- 1-2 lines maximum for the hook
- Include 1-2 relevant emojis (not excessive)
- End with engagement prompt (question, "👇", or "here's how")
- Tag guest with proper title formatting
- Include both YouTube link and episode page link

**YouTube:**

- Single line, slightly more direct
- No emojis required (optional)
- Include full episode link
