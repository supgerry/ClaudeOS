Tim Samson (00:00.427)
But I always try to pronounce a J so

Tim Samson (00:08.214)
alright hold on, I'm going to put this here are we ready? no can't see those alright

Alex Ojeda (00:09.85)
you

John Pendergrast (00:14.677)
Ready.

Tim Samson (00:19.104)
Today we're joined by Alex- I- Side.

Tim Samson (00:26.509)
Today, why do I always do that? today we're joined by Alex Ojeda and Alex represents something completely new in our industry. He's what I call a viral architect. Someone who's figured out how to consistently create content that doesn't just get views but actually drives people to buy tickets and visit attractions. Alex's journey started in 2018 when he helped his grandmother build over a hundred thousand Instagram followers playing Fortnite.

Alex Ojeda (00:33.85)
.

Alex Ojeda (00:40.292)
you

Tim Samson (00:54.699)
Yes, you heard that right, Fortnite. But what makes Alex story remarkable is isn't just that he went viral. It's that he evolved from content creator to strategic business consultant, working with major attractions like Royal Caribbean, where he's actually helping design their new perfect day Mexico, Mexico waterpark. We're just going to skip to the last one and I'll do this after.

John Pendergrast (01:23.369)
Welcome here.

Tim Samson (01:25.038)
I'll skip to last two paragraphs. Here's what makes Alex's perspective invaluable for attraction operators. He's proven that authentic storytelling combined with professional production can drive real business outcomes. Alex, welcome to Signal. Let's dive into how you've mastered the art of turning social media content into turnstile clicks.

Alex Ojeda (01:48.314)
Awesome. Yeah. Thank you guys for having me. I appreciate it.

John Pendergrast (01:51.381)
Welcome here. Welcome here.

Tim Samson (01:55.095)
So let's dive in. Alex, you started by helping your grandmother build a massive following playing Fortnite. And now you're consulting for major attractions like Royal Caribbean on water park design. That's not a typical career path at all. So what was the moment you realized this wasn't just about making viral?

Alex Ojeda (02:16.548)
Ooh, so I would say when I first started it was just about making viral videos and having fun and just messing around and trying to break the internet, quote unquote, which is kind of what we did at the time with Grandma. I would say once I started building my own personal brand and started creating my personal content and pivoted into having an actual niche and getting away from just like trying to make stuff that was just viral and had no, I guess, value or purpose outside of entertainment.

I would say that's when that shift happened.

John Pendergrast (02:51.071)
Did you end up learning how to play, like, do you play Fortnite as well? Or was this like just a thing that you tried with your grandma?

Alex Ojeda (02:58.81)
Yeah, honestly, at the time my siblings were playing a ton and my grandma had just moved in with us. So I just randomly at the time saw a bunch of meme pages of throwing memes up and then also people posting Fortnite content. And so I was like, let me put the two together. Let me get my grandma's face and make it look like she's the one playing, it together and then just post it on Instagram. And overnight it was like 200,000 views.

John Pendergrast (03:02.741)
I'll bet.

Alex Ojeda (03:21.794)
And then we just quickly learned, you we kept making more content and all of those pages that I was actually following and so fascinated by actually took the videos and reshared them. So it was kind of like this big virality over strike. Then that, you know, went from Instagram over to TikTok. It was like another overnight virality. And then I built my personal brand by creating my own channels as well.

John Pendergrast (03:32.171)
That's awesome.

John Pendergrast (03:43.467)
Yeah, that's really cool. That's really cool. You definitely built your own brand. You're on Time's top 25, well, I guess 2025 top 100 creators list. But you've also evolved into strategic business consulting. How do you balance authentic content creation with the business demands of enterprise clients? What's that transition been like?

Alex Ojeda (04:09.464)
Yeah, I mean, honestly, like I, from the content I create now in the industry, like I'm so passionate about two things, right? And that's creating content. That's what I love doing. I love putting a piece of content together and seeing it, you know, how it performs and the creation and all aspects of that. But then I'm also have a huge passion for the attractions, the water parks, the tourism, travel, cruise ships, all of that. And so really what it is is like, I want to immerse myself more into those spaces. And so

While I enjoy creating and my personal brand is always going to be a thing, opportunities just from having those two passions and being so good at creating content just arise from the parks I was working with personally and some mentors, they were just like, hey, can you come help us with our social media presence? And so started with just one park in upstate New York last summer.

John Pendergrast (04:48.725)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (04:58.794)
And we did such a great job that it was just like through word of mouth, saw what the incredible stuff you did there. Can you come help us? And so I just found, I love being a part of the industry more and more. And so as an influencer, right, I may go to a park for a day and create content. As much as I love that, the consulting side allows me to be immersed in it more and also allow my, I guess, talents and content creation skills to be leveraged more than just as an influencer.

John Pendergrast (05:27.307)
Yeah, so I mean, you and I chatted about this a little bit off camera when we were chatting. So it looks easy what you do on the surface of the cameras. Like what you're doing looks easy. You got like such an energy when you're on screen, so forth and so on. It makes it feel like it's a bit of a party, but the reality is it's a ton of hard work behind the scenes.

So making content is one thing, imagining the right content to make is another thing. How do you keep yourself motivated in all of that? it is, I did content a long time ago, but I did content creation as well for a while professionally, and it's a lot of work. What keeps you kind of going and motivated? Because everyone probably thinks you're partying all the time, and that's not at all what's happening.

Alex Ojeda (06:12.602)
Yeah, I guess like everything I do is driven by my family story and like inspiring other people to do the same thing. So in like 2012, know, my parents were in school with three kids. They had just come over from Mexico. And in 2012, they started, my dad started working and he won a $5,000 raffle for a cruise. And as you can imagine, like having three kids and being in both parents at school, it's hard to do vacations like that. And so when

John Pendergrast (06:21.386)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (06:28.074)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (06:41.016)
My dad won that cruise. was like our first kind of shared family experience. And they saw how much fun we had. And for them, it was like a switch in their head. Like, hey, we got to work really hard to continue to provide these experiences for us. And so it was a big staple in my family. So, you know, we ended up doing like 14 cruise vacations and we would always go to water parks, different excursions, theme parks. That was like our thing to do as a family. And so whenever I'm creating, it's kind of like, and I was looking to shift into what my niche was and why I wanted to do what I do.

John Pendergrast (06:41.45)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (07:03.209)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (07:10.874)
It was all driven by like inspiring other families to have that same experience. And so I just know like regardless even the days that you know it is super hard or I feel burnt out doing the more tedious work, things like that. I guess what keeps me going is knowing that like my work has a purpose greater than myself. And so I know that like hey by going the extra mile by you know grinding 24 seven making content and never turning that kind of content switch off.

John Pendergrast (07:15.893)
to do that thing, yeah.

John Pendergrast (07:31.498)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (07:38.85)
I know that I'm impacting others. They're watching my content and they're going out and experiencing these destinations, whether it is just like a day at a water park or it is going on a cruise vacation or traveling across the world to experience these crazy things. I guess I always have that bigger vision. So it kind of like keeps me going where I know like maybe if I was more, a little more selfish, then yeah, I would get burnt out and maybe feel it a lot more. But I think like,

John Pendergrast (07:48.629)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (08:04.858)
That kind of like my family's beginnings kind of like is what drives me because I know other people are having those similar experiences.

Tim Samson (08:11.187)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (08:11.849)
Yeah, sounds like you've been very fortunate. You sound like you have a very close family. least it sounds like, you say that's been kind of a motivator for you to help other families kind of have that same experience. That's really cool.

Alex Ojeda (08:26.072)
Yeah, I mean, I think 100 % we're very, you I come from a Mexican family. And so I was also born in Mexico and we have a big family that everybody so I guess, I guess loving and we're very tight, you know, and so we all want to see each other succeed. And so the story is really like, I think my dad started working at Burlington here when he came to America, and now he's very successful in what he did. And it was all driven by wanting to give us more experiences. And you know, he wanted to work hard so we could go enjoy these things.

John Pendergrast (08:38.921)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (08:47.178)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (08:56.25)
And so for seeing that kind of journey in my parents, like it's very, it's inspirational to like go and try to give other people that experience where they have fun with their families or friends. And then it motivates them to go do something bigger and kind of grow and experience things for their families.

John Pendergrast (09:15.051)
That's cool, that's really inspirational and also like, there's not a lot of families I think out there that have that level of connection maybe, or is maybe not as common as it used to be and it's really inspirational what you're doing there. So, I got us off a little bit off the tangent and that's fine, because I'm actually just really interested in getting to know you and I figure the content will make itself from that perspective, but I'll ask you strategic question.

From a strategic standpoint, how has your consulting model changed how attractions approach their marketing budgets? And are you seeing like a shift from traditional marketing spend into more of a creator partnership kind of scenario?

Alex Ojeda (09:53.466)
a thousand percent. think what the biggest change is like in today's world, everybody, no matter who you are, whether you're the most busy person and even if you let's think, take a water park, right? You have your water park GM who's crazy busy 24 seven running around, running this park, even that person all the way down to the lifeguard or to the guests, everybody is swiping on social media. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are. Um, you can have the president of the United States is for sure everybody's swiping. And so you,

John Pendergrast (10:15.723)
Great, yeah.

Tim Samson (10:22.685)
Well, we know he's swiping. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (10:23.384)
This the the switch is like, I think traditionally there was no I guess ads been allocated outside of maybe bringing small like mommy blogger influencers to the park to reaching people where they are and today it's it's swiping on on their feeds. And so I think now the kind of switch is like, okay, we want we're noticing everybody's on their phone. So that's where our guests are. And so we want to now

John Pendergrast (10:38.921)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (10:49.804)
invest in, you know, getting someone maybe it's hiring a social media manager or coordinator or someone to create content for our channels, right. And so that's a big jump because these parks or attractions have been operating for so long. And they don't necessarily know how to navigate that affection, like, in a way to kind of take advantage of the algorithms, because if you do it in a correct way, you create good content, you do things right, it will reach the people's phones, if you do it incorrectly.

John Pendergrast (11:13.269)
Yep.

Alex Ojeda (11:15.704)
and you create non-engaging content and low performing content, it won't reach those people. And so I think what my kind of consulting has done is it's kind of let people switch to be kind of social first and get on people's phone screens and doing it in the most effective way possible and making sure that every piece of content that goes out for these attractions is actually optimized to take advantage of the organic reach that these platforms do. And it's honestly very simple. It's just we're creating the best piece of content possible.

making sure checks all the boxes and then it's going live and then performing well because since it's good content and we already have guests that are fans of these attractions, these guests engage with it, good content with engagement, then explodes and then we're able to kind of reach that. But it's kind of like flipped it and you know, now that everybody's going into social first, this allows them to kind of like take advantage of social at the highest level.

John Pendergrast (11:57.833)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (12:05.567)
Yeah. Yeah, I like how you say it's very simple. That's a very humble thing to say. The reality is that it's complex and changing all the time. And you spent a lot of hours figuring that process out and continue to figure that process out as algorithms change.

Alex Ojeda (12:17.743)
haha

John Pendergrast (12:22.667)
So, I mean, really cool. There's this kind of famous story that you've probably been asked a thousand times now about riding, that you tend to ride water slides, you know, 10 times to get the perfect shot. And I was watching a few of your water slide videos and I mean, if you look closely and you're looking at the cuts, you're like, okay, yeah, I know that, that's definitely a different cut, things like that, but it's really seamless.

It's really time intensive. think there was one, the one in, is it Norway? The one that does the, it's the fastest water slide that goes and you drop into the center on like the big spiral or whatever. And at the last one, I see you're wearing a shirt and I'm thinking to myself, it probably was getting cold. And you were like, or you're starting to get like water slide burn or something like that. Like it's just after a while, it just starts to wear on you. How do you...

Alex Ojeda (13:05.892)
Hahaha

Tim Samson (13:06.056)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (13:16.203)
How do you convince a CFO or a GM or things like that to let you basically take over that slide for long enough to get those shots? Because they're probably thinking to themselves, get the shot, get out, burning capital, burning opportunity. So how do convince them, like, I haven't got the perfect shot yet?

Alex Ojeda (13:33.922)
Yeah, I think we do a lot of pre-planning. in my personal content, it's like we're scoping out. know, I kind of have in my head, okay, X amount of attractions at this park are going to make for like kind of social media gold. And then I kind of pre-plan, okay, this is exactly what I'll need. And it just varies per park or per attraction. It's like whether we're coming in before hours, we're doing things during the hours or even after hours, or what process they have done in the past with other shoots that they may have some sort of system in place.

But it really just varies but yes, sometimes it is riding up to ten times running up and down a slide tower and it does get very time-consuming because what it is it's like, you know, I'll film something I'll review it and then I'll be like, wait, maybe this angle would look better or this or maybe you have a vision for something because beforehand when I'm pre-planning it maybe looks crazier in person if I do XYZ different angle maybe flying the drone from a back angle maybe a different, you know, like you're saying

John Pendergrast (14:10.965)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (14:26.973)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (14:31.428)
for in that example that you saw, was actually in the Netherlands. I had taken off my shirt because body slides are faster without a shirt on. So I had ridden the slide with the shirt and I said, wait, I can go way faster without the shirt. So that's going to do better in the content. there's little things like that that we're always like kind of like playing around with and trying to see like, how can we make this look incredible or even even more incredible than what it actually is or bring that experience to life? Because what it is is like taking the viewer on the experience.

John Pendergrast (14:34.483)
I can it on the screen,

Alex Ojeda (15:01.272)
viewer feels like all the emotions that you're feeling on the attraction, that's what's going to make the content like actually come to life and then invoke that like emotional draw and investment with a viewer.

John Pendergrast (15:03.551)
Yeah. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (15:12.511)
Yeah, that's really cool. I'm gonna finally let Tim say something, because apparently I'm just dominating the conversation.

Tim Samson (15:19.506)
That's okay, it was a good conversation I was going along with it, but You you mentioned something? You mentioned something a while back about you know hiring a social media manager And I think that that's important and a lot of attractions are doing that I see most of them fail because They hire someone who's good at their personal social media and you've talked a lot about content creation and being strategic about it and

And really thinking through what that means. So, so I think about kind of the missteps and that other attractions have done with this. I don't know how many times I've seen an attraction that always has just images of teenagers when it's really a family attraction, right? Because the person who's doing their social media is getting all their friends to come up and that's the thing that they're in. from a, you know, from the perspective of working with attractions,

Alex Ojeda (16:11.578)
NNNN

Tim Samson (16:18.437)
You're twofold. You're both a consultant and a content creator, right? What do you think attractions get wrong within that space? Both doing it themselves and working with creators.

Tim Samson (16:40.142)
Okay.

Alex Ojeda (16:44.359)
Apologize.

Tim Samson (16:44.397)
Again, there's two of you.

John Pendergrast (16:50.059)
Thank

Tim Samson (16:50.818)
No, I wasn't... Yeah. She can cut it. Post.

Alex Ojeda (16:50.965)
Jerry, are we able to cut?

John Pendergrast (16:56.585)
Yeah. We'll handle it in post.

Tim Samson (16:58.51)
I wasn't sure if it was still recording locally and we just lost his video or something.

John Pendergrast (17:04.555)
Can we drop the other one now?

Tim Samson (17:11.95)
It's a

John Pendergrast (17:16.045)
I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Here we go.

Tim Samson (17:18.66)
Oh, but it shouldn't matter.

John Pendergrast (17:21.737)
No, could you say it all again?

Tim Samson (17:24.837)
No, no. you know, Alex, a little, a little while, a few minutes ago, feels like forever because John didn't stop talking, but a couple of minutes ago you mentioned about going out and, finding hiring a social media manager. And I think a lot of attractions have done that, but I don't know how many times I've seen content that doesn't portray the guests that they serve. So the social media media manager is a young adult or a teenager.

Alex Ojeda (17:25.958)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (17:32.76)
Okay.

Tim Samson (17:52.811)
And all the content is that right? It's stuff that they would post on their personal, not on, on, you know, a parks profile or attractions profile. So you're very strategic and you very thought out and planned about what you're going to post and what the messaging is. But a lot of attractions go into this, you know, either with a content creator or with a consultant. So what are.

What do you think the biggest misconception is either working with a consultant within social media or a content creator that parks or attractions are missing?

Alex Ojeda (18:31.768)
Yeah, I think the biggest thing is that there's no, there shouldn't be any personal preference to anything done on social media. It should all be backed by, you know, how are we making the greatest piece of content possible and how are we making the content that's going to do two things. One, get people through the door in the attraction space and two, actually perform and draw eyeballs. Cause the way we, the way I see it is like,

the more eyeballs on the social media channels, the more percentage of people we can try to convert through to getting people through the door. And so what happens a lot of time that I see is, is there's people, they're doing what they think they need to do, or they're, you know, just taking what they may know and say, okay, this trend is really fun. I want to do that because it looks fun or hey, this idea, they're doing it for personal reasons and they're not doing it for, you know,

they're doing it more because that's what they like to do and not what actually works for the park. And so a lot of times, like when I'm working with my specific clients, they'll have a coordinator that is maybe a little frustrated by me being like, hey, we need to reshoot this or hey, we need to do this a different way. But in the, know, I'm always reiterating like, hey, this is this is not for personal preference. This is just what's going to drive the highest engagement possible. And we need to we need to film something this way, or we need to do this specific video because, you know, here's the track record. And we'll always refer back

to a piece of content that's similar or that another park has done or that another creator has done and said, look, this is the track record. Here's this trend. Here are 10 videos that have done really well recently. Here's how we can integrate it and make it even better than how this person did it. And we're always doing stuff like nothing's personal preference essentially. And so that's kind of where we see a lot of attractions kind of unfortunately lacking is in those areas because they do things for personal reasons.

and not backed by other content examples and things like that.

Tim Samson (20:28.994)
Yeah, yeah, and I think probably the second piece that I think that we see a lot at least from a from an executive standpoint or like the GM within the park is Social media is so hard to attribute to actual revenue. So you're you do it to get people in through the turnstiles into the gate to eat at restaurants do all these things But it's really hard to measure because most of the time you're not purchasing a ticket or you're not doing

doing certain things like that. how do you can go on a little bit off topic here, but how do get the stakeholders? do you get the stakeholders on board to actually allocate funds towards this that it's difficult to attribute revenue to? and then what type of metrics do you use to really convey that back to say that we're successful in this? This is really driving the needle, even though there's not a direct attribution to

Alex Ojeda (21:28.437)
Right. Yeah, no, 100%. I think in traditional or not necessarily traditional, but in the past, you know, parks are used to maybe a third party marketing company or a consultant come on and say, hey, we're going to allocate, you know, let's say it's $100,000 in ad spend and we're going to target these ads to your target market. And we're able to track that X amount of people clicked on our link through this ad and bought the ticket there. And then they can see that direct ROI, right?

in organic marketing and in social where everybody's just swiping, right? It is really difficult to attribute exactly, like, hey, this video went viral. It got a million views and out of this million views, you know, X amount of viewership went and actually purchased a ticket. It's almost nearly impossible. There are ways that like, for example, at some of my specific clients, what we'll do is like they have specific events, right? And we'll say, okay, the first time they hosted this event, we saw like 50 season pass showed up for it.

Then we posted this video promoting the event and it did 800,000 views. And the next time the event came on, 850 season pass showed up. And you know, there was nothing else done differently besides that that one viral video did really well. So there's small cases like that where we can attribute to success or other things that we can attribute is like a lot of these parks and attractions, they have problems with staffing, right? Getting lifeguards, getting people to man the attractions.

And it's always short staffed. so having these incredible videos, what it does is it not only brings guests into the park, they're seeing success in people seeing how fun the park is and seeing how fun the work environment is. And it's helping solve some of those staffing issues. And they can attribute that to not, know, hey, last year we had this exact same issue. We didn't have this social media presence or content. And now we do. Now a lot of our staffing is kind of helped solve itself through that.

But yeah, they're really, it's very difficult to kind of attract. All we can kind of look at is like, we're looking at comments. So like if a video goes viral, right, we'll read, it may have 300 comments on there. And out of those 300 comments, the people who are typically commenting are people within the area. And so we can kind of like attribute, know, if we did a hundred million views throughout the summer, and then let's say out of those hundred million views, I'm just throwing around the numbers, let's say a thousand comments, right? Then we can go in and we can assume,

Tim Samson (23:34.53)
.

Alex Ojeda (23:46.405)
And you can actually read the comments and say, hey, these are people locally engaging because they said, hey, I came here in the past or hey, I X amount away or they're engaging with it. Maybe it's current guests, past guests or people who didn't even know it existed. We're measuring success through the actual comments because we can actually attribute those to people who are in the drive-in markets and things like that.

Tim Samson (24:08.288)
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong. I think everyone knows they have to do it, right? Like everyone knows they have to do social media. It's just part of the marketing landscape at this point. But it is difficult to kind of attribute that with it. I think as an industry...

Again going further off topic. So we're getting further and further down. All right But as an industry, think sometimes on social media we want to curate things and the story that's coming to mind is I'm sure that Everyone has seen it. Probably everyone that's listening right now has seen this the girl who's on the slingshot ride and the seagull lands directly on her Right. It hits her right in the face and goes for a ride with her up and down so that happened at Maury's Beers and it's

when I was there so it's kind of one of those things where it was the guest video we waited for them to post it but in a traditional sense like an attraction would not post that video right because it really kind of goes against everything that they're striving for right it doesn't portray that rides particularly in the best light even though it's this weird freak accident right so it doesn't portray in the the best light and where I'm really going with this is authenticity

Alex Ojeda (25:01.274)
Peace.

Alex Ojeda (25:07.344)
Thank

Alex Ojeda (25:24.368)
Okay.

Tim Samson (25:25.44)
Right. So I come from, I was having this conversation last night at dinner, um, with a photographer and a guy from agency. And we were talking about the ability for the industry when they're taking photos of coasters to have everyone with their hands down. Right. So everyone has their hands in because we're, we're safety first. And that's the thing that we do, but that's not how people ride roller coasters. Right. So there's a balance between authenticity and.

Alex Ojeda (25:41.488)
So. So

Tim Samson (25:55.857)
of sticking to your core values. And I think sometimes that's difficult to get in social media because someone can tell instantly if something's not authentic. So any words of advice to people like how do you balance that?

Alex Ojeda (25:56.72)
It's.

Alex Ojeda (26:10.871)
Yeah, I think in my head it's it's managing a fine line between being authentic and legal and safety. I'm always in favor of being authentic 1000%. And then not only legal and safety, but also like upsetting guests, right? Because in my head, it's like, I want to 100 % of the time go out of the box with ideas. If I see a hate comment, I want to, you know, flip it around and actually make a video on it.

and take things and really be as authentic as possible and just be real. But obviously in some cases it could upset guests and portray negative light and then we're having issues where guests don't want to come to the park. Or it could be a safety thing like you mentioned with, you hey, everybody throws their hands up so we're going to do this trend where we throw their hands up and then maybe it is a legal safety thing. So I'm always trying to like...

you know, scrape that fine line and making sure we're not crossing it, but taking advantage of it as most as possible. And so a good example of this, one of my clients is down in Mississippi, and one of their neighboring parks said, you know, it's still the same management company, but they decided not to open the other park that summer. And so in the market, those are the two water parks in that market. And so

Tim Samson (27:22.099)
We we can pop we can probably say who they are. We work with yeah Mark won't care

Alex Ojeda (27:25.508)
Yeah, so this is, yeah, this is the Gulf Islands waterpark down in Mississippi and the other waterpark in the market is Blue Bayou. And so they're both managed by the same company. But one of things we did is we noticed Blue Bayou is not going to open this year. So we're being authentic and making, we made content that was like, hey, Blue Bayou is not open, but we're here all summer. And so what that did is that content went viral. hit everybody who typically goes to Blue Bayou and they said, wow.

John Pendergrast (27:36.241)
Yep.

Alex Ojeda (27:55.183)
Okay, I didn't know Blue Eye wasn't gonna open. I think that video had like 77,000 likes or somewhere around that. It went crazy on TikTok and Facebook and stuff. so we reading the comments, you there's people being like, wow, I didn't realize you're also just a quick drive away. We're gonna come. And then we saw a lot of those guests converting over. And that's just a great example of being authentic. And then like kind of a horror story, a park in upstate New York that I work with. Not necessarily a horror story, but this is kind of where I'm scraping that fine line is

John Pendergrast (28:14.155)
password.

Alex Ojeda (28:25.176)
They were open for so many years and allowed coolers into the park. You could bring one in, know, ownership came, new ownership came and changed that rule because they said, hey, you know, actually in 99 % of the parks in the US, you know, there's the free cooler thing is no longer thing. The neighboring parks also didn't have that rule. they switched it. like, hey, if you have a seat in pass, you can bring a cooler. But if you're just a day ticket, that's not something we're going to allow. And so.

John Pendergrast (28:29.515)
I know.

Alex Ojeda (28:52.846)
There was a lot of negative comments on social media through the park, just people complaining about that. So I said, hey, how do we use that to our advantage? And we actually made content, you know, filming someone trying to bring a cooler in and stopping them and saying, hey, you need to get a season pass or stopping them and saying, hey, check out all the wonderful food in the park. Now in social media terms, that was awesome. We're getting a lot of views, great attention. But when you read some of those comments, especially on Facebook,

we did see a lot of negative where, know, scraping that line actually was leaning towards hurting us, even though we were getting a lot new eyeballs on the park and actually educating the guests on these things. That's an example of where it, you know, we had to take that content down. So it's kind of like aligning, in my head, we want to align guests' expectations so we eliminate those hate comments. So for example, if your wait times are super long in your park, right, and your guest is going there with the preconception that...

you know, your wait times are actually not that long to get there. They have to wait in line. They're going to go comment a hate comment. But if we make jokes about the wait times, guests see that they still come to the park and they see how fun the video is. They're expecting to wait in that line. And so we're kind of aligning those guests expectations. But again, we're managing that fine line is making sure we're not upsetting guests or, or doing things but using the to our advantage.

John Pendergrast (30:07.807)
Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I can imagine when you're dealing from the park, you're to have different levels of like park ownership being like, hold on, this, this, this, like, there's a bad comment here. And you're to go through that process. How do you handle personally, how do you handle the negativity? Because there's like, you're doing social media, you've got to have an enormous amount of negativity coming across your desk. I've listened to other interviews with different, like influencers, and they talk about kind of the impact of that negativity. How do you handle that?

Alex Ojeda (30:37.984)
Yeah, I mean, I've never honestly never been affected by negativity. I'm not sure what it was when I first started creating. There was a ton of it because it was more personality based versus what I do now. I use the analogy that I'm kind of like the weatherman or like I'm just the credible figure, you know, telling you the weather I'm giving you, you know. But you're never hating on the weatherman, right? You may comment on like

Tim Samson (30:54.695)
I don't look like a weatherman. You could really pull this off.

John Pendergrast (30:57.706)
You

Alex Ojeda (31:04.919)
For example, in my case, they're never hating on me. They may hate on the experience, like, that looks super boring or whatnot. So for me, it never affected me personally. Now, beforehand, when it was more personality based, I did get a lot of hate directly targeted towards me. know, I was also, when I first started, was still in school and, you know, peers around me. Back then, it was not a normal thing or a desired thing to be on social media. They kind of like clowned on it. So, you know, I experienced negativity in person, both on social media and stuff.

John Pendergrast (31:23.787)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (31:34.956)
But honestly, again, when I have that bigger purpose and there's nothing you can kind of tell me that will actually upset me. In contrast, it'll actually motivate me to do more. And so in the attraction space, so when we're getting hate comments, like I said, in my head, it's like, how do we leverage those to our advantage kind of similarly? And as long as we're not upsetting the guests even more and we're actually flipping the narrative or kind of playing it off as a joke.

John Pendergrast (31:58.761)
Right.

Alex Ojeda (32:03.616)
that's where we're actually seeing more success and using it to our advantage as opposed to like, hey, this is a bummer. Or in my client's perspective, it's a great way to take this as kind of guest feedback and kind of getting a lot of guest feedback like, hey, the soda machines at this location in the park are super disgusting and the guest is posting a comment and we're seeing that comment 100 times, that's flagged to management. They're like, okay, we need to go do something about this.

Whereas before, without social media, they may not have been able to exactly. we see a lot of that, or it may be that it could be, and it also could be that there's certain things that people like, and it's not necessarily hate, but it's also they're commenting really good things about a specific thing that they like, or what it might be an event or a policy in the park. Like for example, when I mentioned the cooler scenario.

John Pendergrast (32:36.361)
Not even known. Yep.

Alex Ojeda (32:59.84)
you know, there was a lot of negative comments and the park can learn from those things and those experiences. Whereas before, if we weren't creating that content or if the content wasn't as good and not reaching people, there would be no learnings to come from.

John Pendergrast (33:11.391)
Yeah, so you've basically built a feedback loop in some sense that maybe didn't exist before, which is really helpful. And that feedback loop obviously allows them to make even more content because they can use that to drive the next thing they want to say. Yeah, that's really cool. So from a text, so I've been a nerd my entire life. So back in the day, if you needed to film.

Tim Samson (33:32.954)
Really? No one would have ever guessed. No.

John Pendergrast (33:35.411)
Yeah, I never would have guessed. If you had to film in water, you found a bag that you put over your camera and screw the camera lens over it. You know, that's how you did it. And then everyone started using GoPros. As I understand it, GoPros aren't the choice anymore necessarily, but at the time they really were.

Alex Ojeda (33:37.356)
the

Tim Samson (33:38.576)
You

John Pendergrast (33:50.827)
You have like 360 cameras. So if you're a park and you're like, you know what, really appreciate working with influencers like you also want to do some more content ourselves. What's the kit that you're saying you should go and get?

Alex Ojeda (34:08.556)
Yeah, I mean, obviously, like to your point of tech kind of emerging now, a lot of a lot of things are waterproof. So down down to the phone is water resistant. But yeah, I mean, it's honestly, you know, we're working with drones, working with the 360 cameras, working with iPhones. We have nice microphones that we use outside of that. I mean, that's really is the magic really comes from the phone and the microphones is really where we're filming majority of our stuff.

John Pendergrast (34:15.263)
Yeah. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (34:36.275)
And then, you know, the drone and the 360 cameras just allow us to have B roll or various right shots. but yeah, really you can, you can cook with just a phone and, and some microphones.

John Pendergrast (34:46.133)
So does Apple and DGI sponsor you? Because I feel like that was exactly what Apple wanted to hear. Our phone was so good. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

Tim Samson (34:56.282)
He can neither affirm nor deny that he gets the vaccine.

Alex Ojeda (34:56.298)
No, but I honestly, that's my own unbiased opinion. I do work with some of the action camera companies every now and then. yeah, I mean, we're yeah, we're really, just using the microphone and the phone is just authentically what's what's being used.

John Pendergrast (35:08.64)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (35:15.627)
It's amazing how that technology has advanced. Because listen, I come from a time before cell phones. I had one of the original Motorola blocks kind of idea. And back then, I remember going, you know what would be really cool? They could put a camera in this device. This would be really cool. And now it's really like I'm living in the future. But there you go. I'm showing my age. Yeah. Go ahead, Tim, if you want to move us into part three.

Tim Samson (35:35.387)
No.

Alex Ojeda (35:40.65)
So.

Tim Samson (35:41.755)
Yeah, yeah, we'll move into part three. Which is not water parks. We're gonna move away from water parks. We're gonna slide down. No, I don't know, that was really bad, I'm sorry. So, so your background's... I know.

John Pendergrast (35:53.749)
You're also showing your age. You're telling puns. Yeah, that's, yeah.

Tim Samson (35:59.523)
Whatever puns are fun. No, so your background is heavy heavily water parks and The strategies apply across industries, right? within Within the verticals that we serve as a company You know, there's zoos and museums passenger vessels ferries railway Observation towers water parks kind of that whole thing. I think it's really easy for a

John Pendergrast (36:01.291)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (36:03.946)
Thank

Tim Samson (36:26.305)
Waterpark or a theme park to be like, yeah, we're gonna use social media for xyz. But but what are the kind of those universal things that can cross all those all the different attraction based industries

Alex Ojeda (36:39.751)
Yeah, I think the number one universal thing is that every, regardless of what attraction you are, you already have fans, already have your followers, you already have guests. And so

A lot of the times what I'm doing is I'm working with a property that has been around for, I don't know, many, many years, and they've had hundreds of thousands of guests come every year. When we start creating content, that's our audience that can engage with our content. So we're never starting from fresh. Even when there's a brand new attraction, right? Usually there's some press or stuff that goes around it before it even comes out, or people are saying, no, this is new in XYZ City. Those people who are exposed to it,

every attraction already has some sort of audience, whether you're a water park zoo, doesn't matter what attraction, right, there's already some sort of audience. So it's kind of universal to where if you just create something, there's already going to be an audience to engage with it. So now if you create something good, and you already have that audience to engage with it, that's where you see the engagement explode. So a lot of the times even even with attractions now who don't have some high level consultant or anything, or they are just creating what you'll notice is like, sure, maybe not all their content.

is at that high level, but they may have a few videos that do reach these massive numbers and that's simply because they filmed the trend really well or they did this video really, this specific trend very, very well and that audience kind of engaged with it and those two things kind of made it explode. So that's something that's very consistent between, regardless of what attraction is that there's already an audience to engage with content.

John Pendergrast (38:10.613)
So if I take that a little bit further and I say, okay, so you work in a market that's very kind of thrill-based, right? Like it's like, check out this water slide. It's the scariest water slide you'll ever be on. I ride it 10 times to get this video. But like, there's also a lot more subdued attractions. There's attractions that are like, here's a flower garden you can come walk through. It's like, unless it's gonna turn into plants versus zombies, you're probably not gonna have a really thrill-based environment.

Tim Samson (38:21.049)
.

John Pendergrast (38:36.935)
is what you're saying here is that the same rules apply. You're gonna have an audience to that already and you need to speak to that audience in a way that engages them and you have to determine what that's gonna be. Is that, am I?

Alex Ojeda (38:49.267)
a thousand, yeah, a thousand percent. And even in the less exciting or less thrilling attractions, like, you know, what we're always working on is called, I call it like employee generated content. And that's where we're working with the staff to be on camera personalities and kind of bring things to life. So, you know, it's not necessarily like only just showcasing attractions. We're doing a lot of fun stuff and building that environment to kind of represent the brand through the employees. And so that doesn't necessarily have to come from.

John Pendergrast (39:04.223)
rates.

Alex Ojeda (39:17.501)
the attractions, can come from just, you know, it doesn't have to come from something thrilling essentially.

John Pendergrast (39:22.569)
Yeah, well, we live in an increasingly, increasingly we're hearing more and more about AI and other things and those kinds of tools and what it can do. And yet it's missing that human connection, right? Like it's literally not the human connection. And what you're saying is largely that you're instigating an opportunity to relate to the people that are at these facilities through the videos that you give or that you create. And that gives people an opportunity to go, hey, I want to experience that. That's the thing I want.

Total tangent, but what do you think about the developing world of AI out there and what's happening in the market? How's that influence you?

Alex Ojeda (39:59.645)
Yeah, I mean, I, I'm not necessarily scared of AI at all. I want to use it to my advantage as much as possible. I don't I don't see a world where AI is going to be like, hey, you want an attraction wants to make content or an influencer wants to make content and AI will just do it in two seconds. And I also see the platforms moving away from AI. Like I think YouTube just announced that they're not going to promote any content that's fully AI. So where AI comes

John Pendergrast (40:07.018)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (40:27.217)
into my places and like copywriting or scripting or the pre-production and post-production and kind of how to bring those things to life a little bit easier. That's where, you know, we're using tools like ChatDBT and things like that to kind of help us in the planning stages or via content ideation and things like that. But when it comes to actually like creating the content, I think it's always gonna be a success to physically get in there and be creating every day.

Tim Samson (40:40.128)
it.

John Pendergrast (40:42.003)
Yeah. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (40:52.043)
Well, I mean, there's constant noise in this area. So Will Smith, I don't know, you might be, are you young enough or old enough to know who Will Smith is? So Will Smith just released his video of his new album tour and it very quickly became apparent that the entire audience was AI.

Tim Samson (40:52.194)
Do.

Alex Ojeda (40:57.865)
Yeah

John Pendergrast (41:09.71)
And you know, he's dealing with all the fallout of that. So it's just interesting to watch how the market shifts. I would agree with you. think AI is an incredible tool for things like copywriting and those kinds of things. But for the actual content creation, I don't see you're going to run into any problems anytime soon from that perspective.

Tim Samson (41:25.208)
It's just iterating though. Like it's all iterations with AI like it can't create and I think that's the important thing with social is your you're creating so it can copy someone else's idea or do something but you could quickly miss that authenticity like if say the Say the Human Rights Museum in Winnipeg, which is an awesome museum if you're over there you need to go, right? Say they were to ask about You know how to create a social media campaign

Alex Ojeda (41:25.397)
Right.

Alex Ojeda (41:48.583)
So. Okay.

Tim Samson (41:54.68)
There's a very good chance that what it's gonna come back with is not relevant to that particular subject matter, right? At all. I think that AI is incredible for helping with that pre-production, but it lacks the humanity right now, at least right now. Maybe we'll get there.

John Pendergrast (42:01.086)
Sure.

John Pendergrast (42:13.375)
Yeah, I kind of hope we don't, but yeah, know, possibility. I think the human connection thing, where AI thrives, I think, is the ability to create the content that enables human connection between humans, right? And when you skip that step and go straight to AI to human connections, we run into some really weird stories and things that we probably don't want from a cultural perspective.

So cool, a little bit of an aside, but I'm just always curious. I have kids that aren't a lot younger than you. One of them is 23. And that generation tends to really dislike AI and wants to be authentic, and AI couldn't be less authentic. So it's just interesting. I was just curious about your feedback there. Kind of getting back on script, what?

Alex Ojeda (42:41.991)
Thank you.

Alex Ojeda (42:54.7)
Okay. Okay.

John Pendergrast (43:03.125)
How do attractions build like sustainable content strategies versus becoming dependent on yourself? Now obviously you're building a business, you'd like them to be dependent on you and from that perspective, but there's gonna be a point where you're not scalable enough to service maybe everyone out there that way. No, no, that's where he hires people and teaches them how to do what he does, yeah.

Tim Samson (43:20.277)
That's where AI comes into play. The Alex model, right?

Alex Ojeda (43:24.913)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (43:28.252)
So what's the path to developing internal capabilities that can be augmented by people like yourself?

Alex Ojeda (43:34.533)
Yeah, I think the biggest thing is, honestly, it's what my whole consulting is based off of the building an in-house system for daily content creation. And the simplest answer to that is like for any attraction to just start out by hiring that role. If it is a social media intern, a social media coordinator, whatever it might be, and just get creating as much as possible, even if it isn't daily.

John Pendergrast (43:44.629)
Right. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (44:01.383)
It's like they need to be posting because as we discussed before, like everybody is on their phone, no matter who it is, everybody's swiping. And so it's like, how do we reach people? How do we get in front of the people who are swiping? And that's by creating content. so what essentially like where I come in is, you know, I have eight to nine years of experience of just creating and really doing short form video first and leveraging it to the max. It's kind of like making sure that

John Pendergrast (44:21.247)
Yeah. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (44:30.36)
every piece of content that is shared is being optimized to be the best piece of content possible so that we are reaching and getting the numbers that we want, which in some clients cases, last summer we had a park do 130 million plus impressions across the summer. So it works out really well. Now, the only difference is if a park were to just go hire a social media coordinator, again, it's

it's just that every piece of content again, it's not going to be done off of that kind of personal preference that I was telling you about. It may go down that route as opposed to being all done like in best practices for the algorithms.

John Pendergrast (45:08.287)
Great.

So I'm kind of reading between the lines and tell me if I'm wrong here, but what you're saying is you have seven to eight years of experience of or more to, of trying things and determining over time what works, which means you've probably thrown a lot of things at the wall to figure out what sticks.

Alex Ojeda (45:28.367)
Yes.

John Pendergrast (45:28.651)
and you've learned that process. Now it's kind of instinctual. So what your initial statement, I think, is to say, go start creating content, go start throwing things at the wall. Most of it's probably not going to stick, but then you'll have one that does stick, and then you can start to build those. So what you do then from a consultancy standpoint is to try and help some of those people fast track into, here's the 10 things that I've learned that work at least in broad scopes, and here's how you can start to define those for yourself.

can be authentically you, not just a copy of me from that perspective. Is that kind of what you're doing?

Alex Ojeda (46:05.282)
Yeah, I think you I think the analogy of throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks is a thousand percent Hitting the nail of like yes, we're it's if it's when you're doing things off personal preference That's what you're doing. You're throwing stuff at the wall and maybe things won't stick so now, you know what I'm doing is like, okay, I've already Gone through the trial and error, know I've done I think two billion views every single year for the last like five six years across social media and so it's like

John Pendergrast (46:10.762)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (46:20.841)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (46:30.249)
while.

Alex Ojeda (46:33.845)
Now we're not doing that. It's all, there's no personal preference. It's all just like, you know, these are the best practices across the board that work best. And then, you know, this is the current trends or the current, you know, content styles that are doing very well. And then how are we able to take the attraction at hand and leverage it into the trend or content style, but, you know, make it better. And so, yes, over the summer, what ends up happening is the coordinators at these parks, start to learn.

Tim Samson (46:57.333)
Thank

Alex Ojeda (47:03.237)
more and more and the teams they learn like, okay, this is what we have to do. Here's how we need to film things and here's kind of that alleyway. Now, yes, I am involved with some of these properties over a multi-year term because, you know, they want that consistency and they want to uphold that kind of like level of content. And I guess it's a lot more difficult to kind of like, hey, hand off the rings and, you know, go do it yourself.

John Pendergrast (47:03.454)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (47:16.586)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (47:30.681)
you know, unfortunately it doesn't always work out that way. And they want to keep that high level of content. a lot of the times what ends up happening is that they're only open for a certain amount of time. So there are attractions that are open year round. But a lot of the ones that I work with are, they only have like 90 days or a hundred days of operation. And so they really need to maximize that time and they don't have the time to be throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. They want to make sure that every day is optimized and leveraged to its full potential.

John Pendergrast (47:54.825)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, so it sounds to me like you're kind of heading towards, mean, the one-off sponsored content is where you've kind of had a lot of your success to date. But moving into strategic consulting, it's almost like you're heading towards, what I can see you heading towards is actually a program of almost like guided mentoring or a mentoring program of I'm gonna teach you this is the way that you do these things. Here's the program that you use to do that. And you're essentially,

building, like I'm thinking about, there's programs like this inside of sales that are like predictable revenue is one of these kind of groups that does this. We are building a training program and you're building a way of thinking for people. Is that at all accurate? Is that kind of where you're headed in the long term?

Tim Samson (48:34.793)
Mm-mm.

Alex Ojeda (48:44.146)
Yeah, I just I think it's it's it's obviously showing you the ropes, but it's also what I do is I fold your hand and walk you through the finish line.

John Pendergrast (48:51.177)
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, great.

Tim Samson (48:51.935)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (48:52.96)
So, because, you know, in the past, I've spoken at all the conferences, I've spoken at both industry conferences with IAPA and WWE and I give a lot of free value. Like I've never like, I've never tried to hide it. I could sit here and tell you everything, just like I said, hey, everybody needs to be posting, everybody needs to be creating. But where I saw and why my consulting business actually came to life is because people are like, this is amazing. We, you know, we love this. We love this information you're telling us, but we need accountability aspect.

integrated to it. And not only that, again, like I mentioned before, that, you know, we only have X amount days operation, we don't want to be just floating around and sending someone to just go mindlessly make content like we need this plan, we need a strategy, and we need to be milking the most amount of views we can in this short amount of period of time. And so it's kind of like a mixture of the time sensitivity and the accountability is where I really come in and help them strive because I can give all the knowledge in the world and lay it out there.

John Pendergrast (49:41.515)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (49:47.476)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (49:50.581)
Sure, it doesn't matter if they don't use it. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (49:52.35)
Yeah, and so that's where that's where I was seeing and why there was a lot of interest in what I was doing is because, you know, I gave all this free value, but then the accountability aspect and the time sensitiveness is like, wow, we really want to take advantage of this to the max.

John Pendergrast (50:03.849)
Yeah.

So how do the economics vary on that? Like the economics of one-off sponsored content makes sense. You're negotiating a price for that. The other stuff is much more of a long-term, and you're holding people's hands, and you're walking them through these things, and you're kind of guiding them and mentoring them in some sense.

how do the economics work differently on that? Because clearly, one of them has a much longer term value to you, which is that mentoring side, of course, is going to be the long term value. And at some point, I can only imagine you're going to make content until you're my age, I'm sure, because I think it's in your blood. But also, that mentoring side is going to be where you're probably going to get the biggest value. So how does the economics work differently in your head for those?

Alex Ojeda (50:47.682)
Yeah, I think obviously like my one off sponsor post and even when I'm also straying away from that and trying to build more meaningful partnerships on my content on my personal brand side. So for example, I used to do one off partnerships with the cruise line with Royal Caribbean. Now I work with them as a global creator ambassador, multi-year contracts, like I'm helping other opportunities like designing that water park.

John Pendergrast (50:57.3)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (51:14.115)
I'm always looking for more meaningful partnerships or even I work with tourism boards, right? In the past, they have been just those one-offs, but now it's like, I'm working with them on a multi-year basis where I'll work with them this summer and the next summer. When it comes to the consulting side of things, it's also kind of similar, I would say. Yes, it's a longer term where it's less of like a one-off visit or there's obviously less travel involved, I would say. But I'm usually working on a three-month term with a lot of these properties.

John Pendergrast (51:14.154)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (51:35.21)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (51:42.954)
or attractions and kind of like going on site once doing, you know, kind of the operational setups. I'm teaching obviously in person training and then everything else I'm doing is remotely. So, you know, I'm still working every day. It's just, it's just less like on site than what. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (51:43.083)
interesting.

John Pendergrast (52:02.315)
Less travel, which is great. Travel is great until it isn't. done it enough in my life. Yeah, no, I understand it. And we're going to touch on this yet, but...

Tim Samson (52:03.047)
You

John Pendergrast (52:14.411)
You kind of you kind of the best of both worlds here because you're go on site You're gonna spend time at water parks and I know your aspirations are to have your own water park someday So it's like you're you're training them in something and then also kind of ancillary getting training yourself in how these operations work and what works and what doesn't work and don't put the drink machine there and you know, like those kinds of things that you wouldn't get any other way, so I You're kind of getting two advantages there. But Tim you have a real Caribbean question, which actually ties really well off of what he just said so

Tim Samson (52:39.795)
I feel like you might have answered it already, but I'll ask it anyway. So you were talking a little bit about, you know, relationship building and Royal Caribbean CEO publicly credited you with helping to shape the Perfect Day Mexico water park vision, which is just super cool. Right. So like from from creator to architect, you know, we'll call you a social architect. That's going to be that's my title for you.

John Pendergrast (52:44.452)
Jumping on that one.

John Pendergrast (52:48.981)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (53:03.019)
It's huge, yeah.

Tim Samson (53:08.059)
You know, for attraction design, so how did that even happen? Like, I know you said you've worked with them, but how do you build that level of trust at an enterprise level?

John Pendergrast (53:11.722)
you

Alex Ojeda (53:11.732)
simple.

Alex Ojeda (53:18.69)
Yeah, so obviously it goes down to the core of my content, you know, being family friendly, being brand friendly, being, you know, I guess follower first where it's all value driven. It's not necessarily about Alex Ojeda. Like he's never flexing like, hey, look at me. I'm on this cruise ship and you're not. It's really all value driven and story driven. so

Tim Samson (53:38.781)
But you are on a group right now,

John Pendergrast (53:42.357)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (53:43.675)
yes. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (53:46.242)
I was yesterday, but I'm back home now. But it is kind of a value first thing. And so when a brand sees something like that, I feel like it differentiates me from majority of the influencers who are maybe are more personality based. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it provides a lot more value to the brand. so if funny enough, the story with Royal Caribbean, I was actually just an organic fan of the brand. I've been cruising all the

all my life with my family. And I just happened to be, it actually my grandma's 75th birthday. I was on a cruise ship out of Alaska and I saw someone with a production badge. And also ironically, a week before that, an agency had reached out to me about a cruise partnership opportunity with Royal Caribbean via email. And unfortunately, I didn't end up working out there, but I met them on site while just being an organic cruiser. And they recognized me they're like, my God, we've seen your videos. I just asked out of curiosity, like, hey, do you do social media? And they invited me to dinner.

that one dinner then turned into, we would like to invite you. think it was Odyssey of the Seas was launching. And so I went out there and there was just a trade partnership at the start. They like, hey, we just want to invite you, build a relationship with you. There's no expectation for deliverables, but we just want you to come enjoy and we love your content. And so I went out there and I shared a ton of videos. I tagged them in it. I shared like how much I love the brand and I also created content even though there was no expectation for it. So I went above and beyond.

And they were super happy that content performed really really well and then that then turned into My first one-off sponsorship with them for wonder of the seas that at that time was the world's largest cruise ship And then it just so happened that other cruise lines saw the content. They were very interested in working with me And while I you know, I love the industry as a whole in my heart It was really with Royal Caribbean. And so I just through conversations with them. They were just like hey, we you know, we appreciate you

for letting us know. We'd love to continue our relationship. And so we then, I ended up doing another one off with them. And then on that one off, we discussed doing a year partnership, which I don't think they had done with other creators. And so myself and one other creator got on this year contract and we did a really great job. And then they renewed us for year two. And then it just so happened that in between those two, the product team had been following all this content that I was sharing with the brand and took note of me.

Alex Ojeda (56:11.314)
And they love that I, you know, kind of have that global light and also kind of like what you were saying is that I've kind of learned from from the feedback of my audience what they like and what they don't. And so I think they're I heard that Michael Bailey, the CEO, was in a meeting and that they had proposed to him some slide designs and that he was like, would Alex ride these? And they were like, well, let's ask him. And so that's when I got brought into the project.

I went out for a day to the Miami office and I just sat down with all the vendors and the product team and we just went through slide by slide dissecting, you know, what makes sense to build, what doesn't, how do we think of like a social first kind of mindset and also like a modern and younger, you know, everything at Royal Caribbean is still family first, but there's this big trend in young adults and what's trendy and everybody's kind of moving towards that. so

It honestly just spawned off of that. now the partnership is kind of evolving into more, less of like just, typical influencer collaboration to a meaningful longer term partnership.

John Pendergrast (57:20.949)
Yeah, that's awesome. There's a takeaway there that I think so many people, whether you're an influencer or not, should take, and that is that you're a founder. And the thing that you did there, which is like, every time I see someone who has that kind of drive, I try and find a way to hire them, because, or at least work with them, because that point where you went, we have no arrangement, and I'm gonna do a bunch of work.

and I'm gonna do something for this company or for this thing because I think it's an investment and also I really like the brand but I'm gonna do something and then that in turn pays enormous dividends but there was no guarantee that that was gonna happen.

Alex Ojeda (57:50.079)
Okay.

Alex Ojeda (58:02.844)
Right.

John Pendergrast (58:03.491)
that you, like you said, above and beyond, but that's the investment part. You're investing in yourself, you're investing in the potentiality of where this could all go, and I think that's super inspiring, and I think that's the piece that I pull out of that and go, that's what makes you so special is your willingness to go and put it online and go get it done and work hard and...

take the bet on yourself that it's gonna pay off. And I think if more people did that, we'd have more really cool things out there. so, congratulations, you've done an incredible job and it's really cool watching how you've grown this thing. mean, look, 2. whatever billion views, that's insane for the last few years.

Alex Ojeda (58:43.39)
It's

Alex Ojeda (58:51.902)
Thank you, yeah, no, I really appreciate that.

Tim Samson (58:52.56)
That's alright.

John Pendergrast (58:54.493)
Anyways, I'm sounding like my 50 year old mentor self. Okay, so yeah, that's who I am. So you want to open your own water park. Now, have you picked a name?

Alex Ojeda (58:57.256)
Thank

Alex Ojeda (59:10.792)
have, yes.

John Pendergrast (59:12.709)
And are you allowed to say anything yet? You don't have to.

Alex Ojeda (59:13.63)
I'll say I haven't announced the name publicly ever but I I mean it's not a secret by any means but it is Ojeda Oasis Ojeda Oasis Water Park is the name of the of the water park yes and I'm not gonna share too much more details outside of that until we're like official just because I'm one of those that like really wants to

Tim Samson (59:18.084)
Is it trademarked?

John Pendergrast (59:19.367)
Is this the exclusive announcement?

John Pendergrast (59:29.023)
Wow.

John Pendergrast (59:33.575)
Any other? Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (59:40.84)
you know, be serious and get things rolling before I'm like make the full announcement. that is the yeah, that is the dream and the goal here and something that I'm working for in the next couple of years.

John Pendergrast (59:42.847)
Yeah. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (59:51.071)
That's amazing. I wish you all the best on that. That's truly a spectacular goal. And when I think about where your family came from and what your dad did and the effort he put in, and now he has a son pushing as hard or harder going after those things, and the culmination of that is...

the first of what I likely expect to be many water parks because I can't imagine you stopping at one. There'll be an empire yet before you're done. That's huge and congratulations. Big deal.

Tim Samson (01:00:18.818)
And probably a cruise ship, right?

Alex Ojeda (01:00:22.014)
Appreciate it.

Tim Samson (01:00:24.813)
largest the largest water park it's just one water park there's no rooms water part yeah yeah so you're you know the your evolution has been has been pretty cool overall right like I've known you for a number of years but you know from greater to conference speaker you know tickets call to consultant strategic consultant

Alex Ojeda (01:00:26.225)
Hahaha.

John Pendergrast (01:00:26.955)
There's going to be a real Caribbean one named after him.

Alex Ojeda (01:00:32.35)
So.

Alex Ojeda (01:00:38.558)
you

Tim Samson (01:00:51.854)
It's really cool, you know, and if I can use the term like thought leader, like that's in my head, like that's where you are. Right. And I think that most people would say that. So, and you're not just the influencer anymore. Like you are, you are in a lot of ways, but as Jack Moore used to say, you know, you're more, you're more than you've become. Right. Like in general, like there's lots of potential to do more. And I think with the, with your water park and everything that you want to get out of life and grow this.

Alex Ojeda (01:00:56.382)
you

Alex Ojeda (01:01:19.774)
Thank

Tim Samson (01:01:21.774)
But how important was the credibility shift on this journey? Influencer, content creator, speaker, so on, so on, so on.

Alex Ojeda (01:01:38.902)
Yeah, I think it was the most important thing because I think when I first started, like I said, I was mindlessly creating, there was no end goal or there was no big end albeit. I was kind of just like, hey, this is fun. Let's see where this takes me. I enjoyed creating this. And there was no purpose or vision behind it. And so I think all of this credibility building just allows me to reach those bigger goals and continue my purpose and my why.

Whereas, you know, if not, I would just be just an influencer and, you know, continue to reach a small group of people and not be able to expand much outside of that. And so I think the credibility opens the doors to bigger opportunities, to bigger credibility building things. You know, if you take the consulting with Royal Caribbean, for example, that's an example of that word, the credibility, you know, allowed me to expand into, you know, doing consulting for for

a new water park. That is not something that, you know, that is my dream and what I love doing, but it's not something that would have come if I had just, you know, stayed as just an influencer or kind of like didn't go out outside of that and kind of build my industry expertise.

John Pendergrast (01:02:44.649)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:02:48.907)
Totally. I mean, the story is a great story and you're young guy, so you have a lot of story left to right. So that's really cool. Shall we? Yeah, exactly. So Jerry, should we move into the lightning round?

Tim Samson (01:02:51.81)
Who knows maybe I'll be the first one. All right

Tim Samson (01:03:04.526)
Ha

John Pendergrast (01:03:06.123)
She said, yeah, I'm reading your look. OK, so we have this thing called lightning round, where we just ask questions and you answer them as we always say as quickly as possible. But the reality is neither Tim nor I are able to answer questions quickly. So do as best you can.

Tim Samson (01:03:15.926)
first time we tried this the guest asked us questions and it took me like five minutes to answer one so it was not a lightning rod it did not work

John Pendergrast (01:03:27.499)
It's true. The lesson learned here is don't ask Tim questions. That's the lesson that we're taking. Okay, Tim, kick it off.

Tim Samson (01:03:31.886)
All right, ready? I feel like we need a timer. Jerry, put a timer on the video. Okay, here we go. Biggest mistake attractions make with social media.

Alex Ojeda (01:03:33.649)
Hahaha.

John Pendergrast (01:03:43.305)
Yeah, imposed. Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:03:51.81)
Come on, come on, chop chop.

Alex Ojeda (01:03:54.045)
Okay, I'm gonna have to think of these questions now. Biggest mistake is just not, you know, I see a lot of photo first content still where people are just posting, they have photos on schedule and they just post that all season. There's no video first. And like we said before, everybody's swiping and when you're swiping, you don't see photos, you see video. So to me, that's the biggest mistake.

John Pendergrast (01:03:56.038)
Hahaha!

Tim Samson (01:04:13.194)
OK, let's try this again. John, these are lightning questions. it's OK. John, go ahead.

John Pendergrast (01:04:22.931)
Yeah, yeah. Tick tock, Instagram, wait, Instagram. Is it Insta now? Anyways, Tick tock, Insta or YouTube? Pick one.

Alex Ojeda (01:04:23.483)
You

Alex Ojeda (01:04:34.934)
that's a tough one. I'm going to have to say YouTube.

Tim Samson (01:04:36.524)
scariest water slides you ever filmed.

John Pendergrast (01:04:36.782)
YouTube?

Alex Ojeda (01:04:46.469)
scariest waterslide ever filmed.

Alex Ojeda (01:04:51.259)
I don't know there's one specifically that comes to mind, in my head that may not be the scariest, but I went to in Mexico. There's these slides called slip and flies and you it's kind like a Nike check mark where you start on your you're laying face first and you just fly into a pool. I think the very first time I after doing it a bunch, I'm not scared of anymore, but I think the very first time I did it, I was like, I was this real like this is incredible. It was very scary. And it's very thrilling because you're

John Pendergrast (01:05:07.7)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:05:16.658)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:05:19.961)
launching crazy into the air and then smacking into the water. It's so much fun. But I would say that first initial slide on that was very scary. So I think that's probably the scariest, or at least one of the.

John Pendergrast (01:05:31.691)
that reminds me of this video I saw years ago of this lady going off one of those slides and then she's laid she somehow managed to stay perfectly straight and hit the water and the entire water park turned around because the that thing went viral big time all right um vertical or horizontal video

Alex Ojeda (01:05:47.94)
Ouch.

Tim Samson (01:05:55.712)
What's your grandma's current Fortnite skill level?

Alex Ojeda (01:05:57.211)
and stuff, I think vertical.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:03.771)
Well, if she was still with us, I don't even know. Expert.

Tim Samson (01:06:04.297)
Expert. She's... well... God mode.

John Pendergrast (01:06:08.497)
awesome. Infinite. Yeah. You're gonna have to fix that in post. God, wow. And lighting round is over. that's it. no, that's the tagline right now for this entire thing. What's your... Okay.

Tim Samson (01:06:21.26)
Sorry.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:27.022)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:06:36.372)
most overrated social media trend.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:37.061)
Bye.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:40.47)
most overrated social media trend.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:46.651)
Honestly, I don't have one that comes to the top of mind.

Tim Samson (01:06:47.724)
cruise ships or theme parks.

Alex Ojeda (01:06:57.849)
If we're talking like theme park theme park, like not not water park, I'm gonna have to go with cruise ships.

John Pendergrast (01:07:05.771)
Drone footage, essential or overused?

Alex Ojeda (01:07:09.801)
Ooh, I view it as essential.

Tim Samson (01:07:10.188)
Last time to post.

This is a terrible question. Who came up with this?

Alex Ojeda (01:07:19.127)
My my no no this is great because my my my answer to that I get that asked a lot it doesn't matter my answer is it doesn't matter but as long as people are awake so whatever your time zone is if people are so if you don't go to bed till 10 p.m people are still awake till 10 p.m so or vice versa I prefer to post in the morning because that's when everyone's awake right but that's my that's my two cents on that

John Pendergrast (01:07:45.81)
influencer or creator.

Tim Samson (01:07:46.763)
Worst content collaboration you've ever seen.

Alex Ojeda (01:07:48.51)
creator.

Alex Ojeda (01:07:55.989)
I've ever seen. Ooh.

Tim Samson (01:07:56.991)
I mean that Pizza Hut clone was bad.

Alex Ojeda (01:08:02.105)
content clip.

Alex Ojeda (01:08:05.817)
I don't I yeah, I also don't know if I have one in mind I I have some good ones that I could think of there's this little kid named the Rizler. He's if you look him up later. He's super viral He's just a funny little kid He does like this funny face and he went viral for that and now I see like Hardee's Carl's jr. And them they're working with him as like the face or Arizona iced tea has him coming in as the face Yeah, I don't know if I have any bad ones though, I think that

Tim Samson (01:08:22.837)
Thank

John Pendergrast (01:08:31.403)
Cool.

Tim Samson (01:08:31.595)
Hmm.

Alex Ojeda (01:08:34.585)
But that's what comes to mind is a good one that I've enjoyed recently.

John Pendergrast (01:08:37.771)
I love the positivity because every question we ask you, it's a negative based question you turn around and answer. So I'm going ask you one more. One social media platform you'd eliminate forever.

Tim Samson (01:08:38.25)
Mm-hmm.

Alex Ojeda (01:08:50.434)
Hmm.

That's tough. mean, I don't have one that I would eliminate, but I feel like I don't use Twitter enough to like in my day to day. So if I had to like pick one, it would probably be Twitter.

Tim Samson (01:09:03.657)
most underrated attraction type for content.

Alex Ojeda (01:09:13.561)
Oh, I mean, I think it's like just going back to your core, your attractions. So literally just throwing up ride POVs. You know, I feel like it's not done enough. It's so underrated. you know, if you go to any attraction, you won't see that most of the time. so I'm like, you know, why are people just going back to your core? Why people are coming back to your attraction? Like, I feel like it's like the most underrated simple thing to just like immediately get good content.

John Pendergrast (01:09:41.803)
Yeah, you know what's current to me as we're doing these, we should start with these and then work our way into the actual interview in the future. I think that would be good. It's a good way to get to know each other a little bit too. Analytics or gut feeling.

Tim Samson (01:09:54.219)
Water park

Alex Ojeda (01:09:55.778)
analytics.

John Pendergrast (01:09:59.871)
That's interesting. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I gotta step in on this. That's interesting, because you're a creator, which is very, very right brain, and then you're also very left brain. That's interesting. Fascinating.

Alex Ojeda (01:10:01.966)
Thank you.

Alex Ojeda (01:10:12.782)
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just like to always go off of data and how can I always look at the analytics and see what can I have done better the next time.

Tim Samson (01:10:21.813)
Water parks in the off season? Yes or no?

John Pendergrast (01:10:23.295)
Yeah. Yeah.

Go ahead.

Tim Samson (01:10:31.295)
Well yeah, is no off season in indoor. But yeah, outdoor water parks.

Alex Ojeda (01:10:32.141)
You mean you're talking like outdoor, indoor.

Alex Ojeda (01:10:40.791)
Yeah, like you're so I would love to see it. mean, I don't know if the other people would would be as crazy as I am to go out and freezing cold to to write some slides, but I'm for.

Tim Samson (01:10:49.353)
That would be kind of cool. I think it's about content. Would you post content in your water park in the off season?

John Pendergrast (01:10:50.123)
So like polar bear water perks, like Canadian style water perks. I'm Canadian, so, you know.

Alex Ojeda (01:10:59.681)
okay. yeah, 1000%. I mean, obviously, when you're talking about like feasibility, it's a little more difficult for some people. But 100 % at my specific water park. Yes, it'll be year round content coming out even if there is no other offerings like hotel, campground, things like that. It would still be if it's just seasonal, it would still be content year round. Got to solve the season passes in the off season.

Tim Samson (01:11:09.981)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:11:24.831)
Yeah, totally. Biggest content creation investment attractions should make.

Alex Ojeda (01:11:31.32)
I heard this is really great consultant. name is Alex Ojeda. I would say that that's the big, I mean, in general, it should just be, you know, investing into social first thinking. And so that starts with, like I said before, like just as simple as getting an intern or social media coordinator to start working out at the park.

John Pendergrast (01:11:35.819)
Love it. Love it.

John Pendergrast (01:11:55.978)
Yeah, that's awesome. I love your take too, because I had a mentor once say to me, if you're not willing to bet on yourself, why should anyone else?

Tim Samson (01:12:00.221)
What's your content creation kryptonite?

Alex Ojeda (01:12:01.759)
Ha

Tim Samson (01:12:08.411)
What's the thing that you hate to do?

Alex Ojeda (01:12:09.688)
Can you elaborate on what kryptonite means?

Alex Ojeda (01:12:15.966)
the thing that hate to do, okay. I would say...

Alex Ojeda (01:12:24.152)
That's tough. mean, I enjoy pretty much every aspect of it. I would say like my more favorite things are obviously being in the ground creating. The things that I am less excited about is kind of the, I guess, pre-planning and like figuring out actually where to go, coordinating the logistics of travel and things like that. That's kind of the more things where I'm like, you know, after a while I'm like, I don't want to be doing this. I want to go create or I want to go plan out content as opposed to like, I need to fly to this destination to get XYZ or...

John Pendergrast (01:12:37.087)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:12:53.068)
whatever it might be, right? So I think that's a better.

I guess that's thing I like the least. I guess would be the best way to phrase that.

John Pendergrast (01:13:03.271)
Mm-hmm. It's also nice. That's the thing you can hire for if you need to. Yeah, next big social platform.

Alex Ojeda (01:13:07.17)
For sure.

Alex Ojeda (01:13:12.088)
Next big social platform. I don't know if there's like one specific platform but what I do see is that you know there was a time where long for longer format content was king and everybody was flocking towards that and then short form kind of took over and while I still think short form is still gonna be at the top I think long form is making its comeback. So if we're talking like, you know, YouTube shorts took over I feel like, you know, YouTube long form is slowly gonna start, you know

You know, apparently there was some statistic that, you know, TV is a huge, huge, and even in my content specifically, people are watching my YouTube long form on TV. It's like the biggest percentage sometimes. So I think when you talk about like the next big thing, I think it's going to be that, you know, TV is coming back as well. People are watching longer format content on television.

Tim Samson (01:13:59.4)
Best reaction you've ever gotten from a video

John Pendergrast (01:14:01.567)
good, attention spans are starting to increase again. That's good.

Alex Ojeda (01:14:04.3)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:14:11.093)
Ooh, best reaction. mean, I my biggest, like what I love the most is creating like some magical video for a brand that I'm that I'm really passionate about. And then them going just crazy about it. What with Royal Caribbean, one of the my favorite videos ever made was there was this trend going around where people would go into a restaurant and the waiter would be like, enjoy your food. And then the person would say back, thanks, you too. And the waiter would look back, be like, me too. And then it cuts them.

having shots of pizza or whatever the food wasn't together. And then they would say, have a great day. The person would say, you too. And the waiter would be like, me too. And then they would, you know, then show the guest doing the dishes and, and waiting the tables and stuff. And so I, I took this trend to the water park on Royal Caribbean's Island and I did it. was like, have a great day at the water park. Thanks you too. And then we montage shots of us having fun. And then it was like, you know,

you know, have a great day to the staff. then, you know, I went back and I started like setting people down slides, lifeguarding and doing that. And that video, it just came out so well when I showed it to the director of social media at the time at Royal. She started tearing up of how like like crying of how good it was and how like good it made her feel. And so for me, that is probably one of the best reactions I've had for from a from a video. And I personally love to see because it's like it's like that satisfaction of like two awesome brands coming together and building something.

John Pendergrast (01:15:27.881)
That's awesome. Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:15:36.502)
creating something magical, that's the best reactions for sure.

John Pendergrast (01:15:40.201)
Yeah, that's really cool. Right, the last question. Content creation in five years, what changes?

Alex Ojeda (01:15:47.59)
content creation in five years, what changes?

Honestly, think what changes is content is just gonna continue to get better and better because there's gonna be so much content and so many people are starting to create more and more every day and there's more and more platforms and it's more and more easier to create that when you have so much content coming out, the only content that's gonna succeed is the good stuff. So I think what's gonna happen is it's like that phrase they say, like the great thing about America's competition, it's gonna apply to.

content creation where content is just going to get better and better and better over the next five years to the point where to succeed, you really have to be good at it.

John Pendergrast (01:16:24.491)
Yeah, it's because everyone's gonna learn your system. That's why it's gonna get better and better. That's good. Alex, it's been great having you with us today. Any questions you have for us?

Alex Ojeda (01:16:27.616)
haha

Tim Samson (01:16:38.403)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:16:39.038)
I did not come prepared for that question.

John Pendergrast (01:16:41.579)
It's totally fine. We can cut it in post too. That's fine.

Alex Ojeda (01:16:46.122)
Yeah, I I think one of the one of the big things, you know, from the ticketing side of social media is is right now we're seeing a lot of stoppable short form video being a thing. know, TikTok shop is huge and it's doing very well. And they're now experimenting with like concert tickets and movie tickets and things like that. I guess, where do you see social media in the next five years? And in my head, how, you know, attractions can leverage that going forward with

John Pendergrast (01:16:52.064)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:17:00.416)
Yep.

Alex Ojeda (01:17:14.292)
in my eyes would be incredible to see some sort of integration there.

John Pendergrast (01:17:20.927)
Yeah, so this is probably can go a little bit further afield because you asked me a question and I'm gonna spend five minutes answering it. Yeah, so there's a very famous technologist and kind of like futurist named Ray Kurzweil.

Tim Samson (01:17:23.078)
I'm gonna see if we agree on this.

Alex Ojeda (01:17:27.264)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:17:30.752)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:17:39.063)
And Ray Kurzweil is a scientist, he's built a lot of things. He was very involved in building a bunch of music hardware and things like that at one point in time. And he's done a lot of things in computers and otherwise. And he predicted years and years ago that by this point, we would be driving most of our interactions with computers through voice. And I think it's really interesting because I think that's likely gonna be true in the next two years.

Alex Ojeda (01:17:53.909)
We are not going be that. We to to that. We to to We are We are that. are to are going We are We are We are to We are to We are going to We to We are are to We are to that. We

John Pendergrast (01:18:08.619)
And what you're seeing more and more is people talking to their chat GPT to take notes or to summarize things or like these kind of things. They're walking around with devices and they're interacting more and more and it's less and less texting and it's gonna be more and more talking.

I think that's where we're going. And so when you think about how this fits into the social media side of things, I don't know how it ties in, but I think it's going to be more interactive. And so right now we interact largely by posting something and then having people interact with it. And I think while I don't like the methodology or ideology behind metas push into this idea of everyone having a giant set of goggles on their head and living in the virtual space, I do think they're

Alex Ojeda (01:18:49.845)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:18:53.693)
partially onto something that we need to get more of this and less of this. And the way to do that is to start interacting again in ways that actually are human reactions in real time. And so voice is gonna be one of them. I think video will kick in pretty quickly after that where you'll have more direct interactions with people on social media.

Alex Ojeda (01:19:03.604)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:19:19.935)
where maybe they won't just be like one to many, but you'll have more one to ones as well. then those will be able to, and I don't know how the technology is gonna work, but I think that there is this world where social media becomes much more of a relational thing than necessarily just a fire and forget kind of thing.

Alex Ojeda (01:19:29.44)
Okay. Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:19:39.519)
And I think your content kind of speaks to that a little bit because you're trying to build an emotional reaction in people to what you said about the Royal Caribbean. Her experience of tearing up, I love this video, really spoke to me emotionally. I think we need more of that. And we need more of those human kind of moments. And so I think social media is gonna start heading in that direction more.

Alex Ojeda (01:19:57.972)
Right.

John Pendergrast (01:20:06.123)
Because I think your generation and younger really wanted to. They wanna have legitimate, authentic connections with people. And millennia before you wanted to have curated, perfect pictures and less and less is that happening. So I don't know, that's kind of a rambling answer and we can probably fix all that in post, but that's kind of what I see. And so how that applies to ticketing, I don't know.

Alex Ojeda (01:20:22.835)
So.

Tim Samson (01:20:31.461)
Okay.

Alex Ojeda (01:20:33.588)
.

John Pendergrast (01:20:36.267)
I've got lots of theories, but I don't know exactly how it's going to pan out. Now Tim, do want to give a five word answer and summarize all that down?

Tim Samson (01:20:36.293)
No, like like I I see your I see your viewpoint I I think that I'm gonna say something controversial and then I'm back up I don't think I don't think social media is gonna exist in five years because it's just gonna be media right like it filled a gap in a time when Marketing wasn't personalized marketing wasn't one-to-one the connections that

Alex Ojeda (01:20:44.084)
Thank

John Pendergrast (01:20:53.642)
Nice.

Tim Samson (01:21:05.568)
attractions made with their guests were a little generic and bland. And I think that social media came in as a way for us to engage with each other. But there's a there's a bit of authenticity that's missed from it from a one to one connection, because as good as you get with it from a attraction standpoint or from a creator standpoint, it still doesn't feel like like this, like we're connecting, you know, personally with each other.

Alex Ojeda (01:21:11.475)
So.

Tim Samson (01:21:35.212)
And I think as technology evolves and as. Attractions and and non-technical folks. said, folks, that's a really strange word are able to are able to engage with their guests in meaningful one-to-one ways because technology has created the bandwidth for it. I think that all of this just becomes social. Yeah, like all of this becomes media. And I actually see a world where social.

what we consider social media today is really just the marketing of attractions in the future. And a lot of the things.

John Pendergrast (01:22:16.875)
Listen, social media. I was gonna say, it used to be that social media was you had your friends over to watch a movie. Right? That was media and you were social about it. Like you'd go and watch, like that was social media. And the idea of broadbanding social media out to, put something here, now I don't have to actually talk to you. I can just live my life.

Tim Samson (01:22:18.584)
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda (01:22:22.227)
.

Alex Ojeda (01:22:37.491)
you

John Pendergrast (01:22:37.503)
through the videos or pictures that I post, which I can purely curate and now don't actually have to be authentic and then do it at scale in such a way that you have a lot of influencers that are arguably doing mental harm to some of the people that are out there by curating what looks like a perfect life but actually isn't that at all behind the scenes. And that I think I would argue would be great if that went away.

Alex Ojeda (01:22:45.203)
Thank

John Pendergrast (01:23:03.391)
I think the technology that we have is really cool and there's ways of using it. I study a lot of brain science stuff because it's fascinating to me. And what we're doing right now is human interaction. But when you do this in person, for whatever reason, there's some sort of like, they call it, they kind of colloquially, or colloquially called it like human networking or human Wi-Fi. When you do this in person, your brains synchronize.

Tim Samson (01:23:19.042)
Mm-hmm.

Alex Ojeda (01:23:26.131)
.

John Pendergrast (01:23:29.385)
and you get brainwave synchronization and you actually connect. When you do this over a camera, that doesn't happen. And they don't know why yet. So they're working on figuring out why. If we can figure that out, then I think we finally find a position where we can do social media. But once again, it's still going to be more one-to-one. So I think I would agree with you, Tim. So anyways.

Tim Samson (01:23:33.609)
technology advances to the point where it...

Tim Samson (01:23:48.162)
Yeah, so I think the people that are not doing social media now are going to be...

Alex Ojeda (01:23:49.587)
Okay.

Tim Samson (01:23:54.495)
or are not doing it well or are not investing in it are going to look back and say, I wish we spent more time. I wish we spent more resources. I wish we moved further because the learnings today are going to be how you engage with guests in the future.

Alex Ojeda (01:24:12.307)
Thank

John Pendergrast (01:24:18.517)
When it's crucial that you like Alex continue to create content that's authentic. Because that's the kind of content that is gonna get shared one to one with people. Right? And I think that's a really important part of the equation.

Tim Samson (01:24:30.39)
That feels like a good spot.

Alex Ojeda (01:24:30.483)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:24:37.449)
Yeah. See, this is what you get. We asked you question and we took out 30 minutes of time to answer it. Thanks for the time.

Alex Ojeda (01:24:39.41)
Thanks.

Tim Samson (01:24:41.078)
Yeah. So thank you. Thanks so much for joining us and, you know, themes we explored today, authentic storytelling drives measurable results. professional production standards separate viral content from amateur, right? Strategic partnerships, one-off sponsorship deals, create sustainable value and cross-platform optimization. So maximize content investment for our.

Thanks a lot for joining us. Any last words?

Alex Ojeda (01:25:10.257)
No, just thank you guys for having me. I appreciate the time and it's excited to see this go live and it's great. Great, great conversations.

Tim Samson (01:25:25.602)
Thanks a lot. See you at IFA. All right. Or W-A-A.

John Pendergrast (01:25:27.497)
Yeah, really good. Thank you very much.

Alex Ojeda (01:25:30.501)
Thank you guys.

See you.
