Alex Ojeda: 
00:00-00:01
Everybody is swiping on social media.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:01-00:03
It doesn't matter who you are or where you are.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:04-00:06
You can have the president of the United States for sure.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:07-00:07
Everybody's swiping.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:08-00:09
The Switch is like.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:09-00:17
Traditionally, there was no, I guess, ad spend allocated outside of maybe bringing small like mommy blogger influencers to the park to reaching people where they are.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:17-00:20
And today, it's swiping on their feed.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:20-00:22
Sometimes it is writing up to 10 times.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:22-00:28
Running up and down a slide tower, I'll review it and they'll be like, Oh, wait, maybe this angle would look better or this.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:28-00:33
Michael Bailey, the CEO, was in a meeting and that they had

Alex Ojeda: 
00:31-00:34
Proposed to him some slide designs and that he was like, Would Alex ride these?

Alex Ojeda: 
00:35-00:36
They were like, Well, let's ask him.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:36-00:39
And so that's when I got brought into the project.

Alex Ojeda: 
00:41-00:41
P

Geraldine Lee: 
00:42-00:50
You're listening to Signal, the podcast for attraction leaders shaping the future of guest experiences.

Geraldine Lee: 
00:51-00:53
This is Signal.

Tim Samson: 
00:53-00:55
Today, we're joined by Alex Ojeda.

Tim Samson: 
00:55-00:57
Alex represents something completely new in the industry.

Tim Samson: 
00:57-01:01
He's not just a content creator, he creates content that doesn't just get views.

Tim Samson: 
01:02-01:04
Drives guests to buy tickets and visit attractions.

Tim Samson: 
01:04-01:11
His story started back in 2018 when he helped his grandmother amass more than a hundred thousand followers on Instagram, doing of all things playing Fortnite.

Tim Samson: 
01:11-01:14
You heard that right, his grandmother playing Fortnite.

Tim Samson: 
01:13-01:27
But what's really cool about Alex's story is not that he went viral, but that he evolved from content creator to strategic consultant, working with household brands like Royal Caribbean, where he's helping them design their new perfect-day Mexico water park.

Tim Samson: 
01:27-01:30
Go figure that, a content creator helping design a waterpart.

Tim Samson: 
01:30-01:39
With over two billion views across 14 million followers, the attractions that he works with not just see increases in followers, but also real world results.

Tim Samson: 
01:39-01:45
Recognized among Times 2025 Top 100 Creators list, Alex is positioned as an industry expert, and rightfully so.

Tim Samson: 
01:45-01:51
And more importantly, he gives back to the industry by speaking at IAP and the World Water Park Association.

Tim Samson: 
01:51-01:58
What makes this perspective so meaningful to tour and attractions operators is that he combines authenticity with professional production to drive results.

Tim Samson: 
01:58-02:00
Alex, we're excited to have you on Signal.

Tim Samson: 
02:00-02:05
Let's dive in, pun intended, and learn how you mastered the art of turning content into clicks.

Tim Samson: 
02:05-02:07
But the kind that count turnstile clicks.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:07-02:07
Awesome.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:07-02:07
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:08-02:08
Thank you guys for having me.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:09-02:09
I appreciate it.

John Pendergrast: 
02:09-02:10
Welcome here.

Tim Samson: 
02:10-02:10
So let's dive in.

Tim Samson: 
02:11-02:15
Alex, you started by helping your grandmother build a massive following playing Fortnite.

Tim Samson: 
02:15-02:19
And now you're consulting for major attractions like Royal Caribbean on Water Park Design.

Tim Samson: 
02:19-02:22
That's not a typical career path at all.

Tim Samson: 
02:22-02:27
So what was the moment you realized this wasn't just about making viral videos anymore?

Alex Ojeda: 
02:27-02:36
Oh, so I I would say when I when I first started, it was just about making viral videos and having fun and just messing around and trying to break the internet, quote unquote.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:36-02:38
Which is kind of what we did at the time with grandma.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:38-02:49
But I would say, once I started building my own personal brand and started creating my personal content and pivoted into having an actual niche and getting away from just like

Alex Ojeda: 
02:47-02:52
Trying to make stuff that was just viral and had no, I guess, value or purpose outside of entertainment.

Alex Ojeda: 
02:52-02:54
I would say that's when that shift happened.

John Pendergrast: 
02:54-02:58
Did you end up learning now to play F like, do you play Fortnite as well?

John Pendergrast: 
02:58-03:00
Or was this like just a thing that you tried with your grandma?

Alex Ojeda: 
03:01-03:12
Yeah, honestly, at the time my my siblings were playing a ton, and my grandma had just moved in with us, so I I just randomly at the time saw a bunch of meme pages of uh

Alex Ojeda: 
03:10-03:12
Throwing memes up and then also people posting Fortnite content.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:12-03:14
And so I was like, let me put the two together.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:15-03:18
Let me get my grandma's face and make it look like she's the one playing.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:18-03:20
did it together and then just posted it on Instagram.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:20-03:22
And overnight, it was like two hundred thousand views.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:23-03:32
And then we just quickly learned we kept making more content and all the those pages that I was actually following and so fascinated by actually

Alex Ojeda: 
03:30-03:31
Took the videos and reshared them.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:31-03:34
So it was kind of like this big virality overstrike.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:35-03:37
Then that, you know, went from Instagram over to TikTok.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:37-03:39
It was like another overnight virality.

Alex Ojeda: 
03:39-03:41
And then I built my personal brand by creating my own channels as well.

John Pendergrast: 
03:42-03:42
Yeah, that's really cool.

John Pendergrast: 
03:43-03:44
You definitely built your own brand.

John Pendergrast: 
03:44-03:49
You're on Times 2025 Top 100

John Pendergrast: 
03:47-03:51
creators list, but you've also evolved into strategic business consulting.

John Pendergrast: 
03:51-03:57
How do you balance authentic content creation with the business demands of enterprise clients?

John Pendergrast: 
03:56-03:58
What's that transition been like?

Alex Ojeda: 
03:58-04:04
Yeah, I mean, honestly, like, from the content I create now in the industry, like, I'm so passionate about two things, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
04:04-04:05
And that's creating content.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:05-04:06
That's what I love doing.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:06-04:07
I love.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:07-04:12
putting a piece of content together and and seeing it, you know, how it performs and the creation and all aspects of that.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:12-04:19
But then I also have a huge passion for the attractions, the water parks, the tourism

Alex Ojeda: 
04:17-04:18
travel, cruise ships, all of that.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:18-04:22
And so really what it is, is like I want to immerse myself more into those spaces.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:22-04:31
And so while I enjoy creating and my personal brand is always going to be a thing, opportunities just from having those two passions and being so good at creating content just arise.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:31-04:38
From the parks I was working with personally, and some mentors, they were just like, hey, can you come help us with our social media presence?

Alex Ojeda: 
04:38-04:41
And so it started with just one park from

Alex Ojeda: 
04:39-04:46
In upstate New York last summer, and we did such a great job that it was just like through word of mouth: hey, we saw what incredible stuff you did there.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:46-04:47
Can you come help us?

Alex Ojeda: 
04:47-04:50
And so, I just

Alex Ojeda: 
04:48-04:50
Found I love being a part of the industry more and more.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:50-04:53
And so, as an influencer, right, I may go to a park for a day and create content.

Alex Ojeda: 
04:53-05:03
And as much as I love that, the consulting side allows me to be immersed in it more and also allow my, I guess, talents and

Alex Ojeda: 
05:01-05:04
And content creation skills to be leveraged more than just as an influencer.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:05-05:05
Yeah.

John Pendergrast: 
05:05-05:08
So, I mean, you and I chatted about this a little bit off camera.

John Pendergrast: 
05:09-05:13
It looks easy what you do on the surface of the cameras, what you're doing.

John Pendergrast: 
05:13-05:14
It looks easy.

John Pendergrast: 
05:14-05:17
You got like such an energy when you're on screen, so forth and so on.

John Pendergrast: 
05:17-05:22
It makes it feel like it's a bit of a party, but the reality is it's a

John Pendergrast: 
05:21-05:22
ton of hard work behind the scenes.

John Pendergrast: 
05:22-05:24
So making content is one thing.

John Pendergrast: 
05:24-05:26
Imagining the right content to make is another thing.

John Pendergrast: 
05:26-05:28
How do you keep yourself motivated in all of that?

John Pendergrast: 
05:29-05:35
Because it is I I did content like a long time ago, but I did content creation as well for for a while professionally and

John Pendergrast: 
05:34-05:35
Is a lot of work.

John Pendergrast: 
05:36-05:38
What keeps you kind of going and motivated?

John Pendergrast: 
05:39-05:42
Because everyone probably thinks you're partying all the time, and that's not at all what's happening.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:42-05:50
Yeah, I guess like every everything I do is driven by my family story and like inspiring other people to do the same thing.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:51-05:54
In like 2012, you know, my parents were in school with three kids.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:54-05:56
They had just come over from Mexico.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:56-05:56
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
05:56-06:00
And in 2012, they started, my dad started working and he won.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:00-06:02
A $5,000 raffle for a cruise.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:02-06:07
And as you can imagine, having three kids and being in both parents in school, it's hard to do vacations like that.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:07-06:13
And so when my dad won that cruise, it was like our first

Alex Ojeda: 
06:10-06:12
Kind of shared family experience.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:12-06:13
And they saw how much fun we had.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:13-06:19
And for them, it was like a switch in their head: like, hey, we got to work really hard to continue to provide these experiences for us.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:18-06:21
And so it was a big staple in my family.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:21-06:26
We ended up doing like 14 cruise vacations, and we would always go to water parks, different excursions, theme parks.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:26-06:28
And that was like our thing to do as a family.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:28-06:29
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:29-06:35
And so whenever I'm creating, it's kind of like and I was looking to shift into what my niche was and why I wanted to do what I do.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:35-06:40
It was all driven by like inspiring other families to have that same experience.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:40-06:40
To do that thing.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:40-06:48
And so I just know, like, regardless, even the days that you know it is super hard or I feel burnt out doing the more tedious work.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:47-06:48
Things like that.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:48-06:53
I guess what keeps me going is knowing that, like, my work has a purpose greater than myself.

Alex Ojeda: 
06:53-06:58
And so I know that, like, hey, by going the extra mile, by

Alex Ojeda: 
06:56-07:02
You know, grinding 24-7, making content and never turning that kind of content switch off, I know that I'm impacting others.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:02-07:09
They're watching my content and they're going out and experiencing busy destinations, whether it is just like

Alex Ojeda: 
07:07-07:12
a day at a water park or it is going on a cruise vacation or traveling across the world to experience these crazy things.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:13-07:15
I guess I I always have that bigger vision.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:15-07:20
So it kind of like keeps me going where I know like

Alex Ojeda: 
07:18-07:22
maybe if I was more a little more selfish, then yeah, I would get burnt out and maybe feel it a lot more.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:22-07:30
But I think like that kind of like my family's beginnings kind of like is what drives me because I know other people are having those similar experiences.

John Pendergrast: 
07:30-07:32
Yeah, it sounds like you've been very fortunate.

John Pendergrast: 
07:32-07:34
It sounds like you have a very close family.

John Pendergrast: 
07:34-07:41
At least it sounds like if you say that's been a kind of a motivator for you to help other families kind of have that same experience.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:41-07:43
Yeah, I I mean, I I think one hundred percent.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:43-07:49
We're very you know, I come from a Mexican family, and so I was also born in Mexico, and we have a big family and everybody.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:49-07:53
So I guess

Alex Ojeda: 
07:51-07:54
I guess loving, and we're very tight, you know, and so we all want to see each other succeed.

Alex Ojeda: 
07:54-08:01
And so, the story is really like: I think my dad started working at Burlington here when he came to America, and now he's very successful in what he did.

Alex Ojeda: 
08:01-08:03
And it was all driven by wanting to give us.

Alex Ojeda: 
08:03-08:08
More experiences, and he wanted to work hard so we could go enjoy these things.

Alex Ojeda: 
08:08-08:16
And so, for seeing that kind of journey in my parents, it's very inspirational to go and try to give other people that experience.

Alex Ojeda: 
08:16-08:24
where they have fun with their families or friends, and then it motivates them to go do something bigger and kind of grow and experience things for their families.

John Pendergrast: 
08:24-08:25
That's really inspirational.

John Pendergrast: 
08:25-08:28
And also like

John Pendergrast: 
08:26-08:33
there's not a lot of families, I think, out there that have that level of connection maybe or as maybe not as common as it used to be, and that's really inspirational what you're doing there.

John Pendergrast: 
08:33-08:40
From a strategic standpoint, how has your consulting model changed how attractions approach their marketing budgets?

John Pendergrast: 
08:40-08:45
And are you seeing like the shift from traditional marketing spend into more of a creator partnership kind of scenario?

Alex Ojeda: 
08:46-08:46
A thousand percent.

Alex Ojeda: 
08:47-08:50
I think what

Alex Ojeda: 
08:48-08:56
The biggest change is like into today's world, everybody, no matter who you are, whether you're the most busy person, and even if you let's think take a water park, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
08:56-09:00
You have your water park GM who's

Alex Ojeda: 
08:58-09:04
Crazy busy 24/7 running around, running this park, even that person all the way down to lifeguard or to the guest.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:04-09:05
Everybody is swiping on social media.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:05-09:08
It doesn't matter who you are or where you are.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:09-09:12
You can have the President of the United States is for sure everybody's swiping.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:13-09:15
And so you know he's swiping.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:15-09:16
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:18-09:19
The switch is like.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:19-09:28
Traditionally, there was no, I guess, ad spend allocated outside of maybe bringing small like mommy blogger influencers to the park to reaching people where they are.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:28-09:30
And today it's swiping on their feeds.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:30-09:34
And so I think now the kind of switch is like

Alex Ojeda: 
09:32-09:34
Okay, we're noticing everybody's on their phone.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:35-09:36
So that's where our guests are.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:36-09:44
And so we want to now invest in, you know, getting someone, maybe it's hiring a social media manager or a coordinator or someone to create content for our channels, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
09:45-09:55
And so that's a big jump because these parks or attractions have been operating for so long, and they don't necessarily know how to navigate that in a way to kind of take advantage of the algorithms because if you do it in a correct way.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:55-09:59
you create good content, you do things right, it will reach people's phones.

Alex Ojeda: 
09:59-10:04
If you do it incorrectly and you create non-engaging content and low performing content, it won't reach those people.

Alex Ojeda: 
10:05-10:10
And so I think what my kind of consulting has done is it's kind of

Alex Ojeda: 
10:09-10:22
Let people switch to be kind of social first and get on people's phone screens and doing it in the most effective way possible and making sure that every piece of content that goes out for these attractions is actually optimized to take advantage of the organic reach that these platforms do.

Alex Ojeda: 
10:22-10:23
And it's honestly very simple.

Alex Ojeda: 
10:23-10:24
It's just

Alex Ojeda: 
10:23-10:35
We're creating the best piece of content possible, making sure it checks all the boxes and then it's going live and then performing well because since it's good content and we already have guests that are fans of these attractions, these guests engage with it.

Alex Ojeda: 
10:35-10:39
good content with engagement then explodes and then we're able to kind of reach that.

Alex Ojeda: 
10:39-10:47
But it's kind of like flipped it and you know, now that everybody's going into social first, this allows them to kind of like

Alex Ojeda: 
10:45-10:47
take advantage of social at the highest level.

John Pendergrast: 
10:48-10:49
Yeah, and I like how you say it's very simple.

John Pendergrast: 
10:50-10:52
That I mean, that's a very humble thing to say.

John Pendergrast: 
10:52-10:55
The reality is that it's

John Pendergrast: 
10:53-11:01
Complex and changing all the time, and you've spent a lot of hours figuring that process out and continue to figure that process out as algorithms change.

John Pendergrast: 
11:02-11:03
So, I mean, really cool.

John Pendergrast: 
11:03-11:06
There's this

John Pendergrast: 
11:04-11:13
Kind of famous story that you've probably been asked a thousand times now that you tend to ride water slides ten times to get the perfect shot.

John Pendergrast: 
11:14-11:15
I was watching a few of your water slide videos.

John Pendergrast: 
11:16-11:22
And I mean, if you look closely and you're looking at the cuts, you're like, okay, yeah, I know that that's definitely a different cut, things like that.

John Pendergrast: 
11:22-11:23
But it's really seamless.

John Pendergrast: 
11:23-11:24
It's really time intensive.

John Pendergrast: 
11:25-11:34
I think there was one the one in is it Norway, the one that does the it's the fastest water slide that goes and you drop into the center on like the big

John Pendergrast: 
11:32-11:33
Spiral or whatever.

John Pendergrast: 
11:33-11:38
And at the last one, I see you're wearing a shirt, and I'm thinking to myself, it probably was getting cold.

John Pendergrast: 
11:38-11:42
And you're like, or you're starting to get like water slide burn or something like that.

John Pendergrast: 
11:42-11:45
Like, it's just after a while, it just starts to wear on you.

John Pendergrast: 
11:46-11:53
How do you convince a CFO or a GM or things like that to let you basically take over that slide for long enough to get those shots?

John Pendergrast: 
11:53-11:57
Because they're probably thinking to themselves

John Pendergrast: 
11:55-11:58
Get the shot, get out, burning capital, burning like opportunity.

John Pendergrast: 
11:58-11:59
So, how do you convince them?

John Pendergrast: 
11:59-12:01
Like, I haven't got the perfect shot yet.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:01-12:04
Yeah, I think we do a lot of

Alex Ojeda: 
12:02-12:03
Pre-planning.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:03-12:06
So, in my personal content, it's like it's like we're scoping out.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:06-12:12
I kind of have in my head, okay, X amount of attractions that this park are going to make for like kind of social media gold.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:12-12:14
And then I kind of pre-plan, okay, this is exactly what I'll need.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:15-12:17
And it just varies per park or per attraction.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:17-12:22
It's like whether we're coming in before hours, we're doing things during the hours, or even after hours.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:22-12:26
Or what processes they have done in the past with other shoots that they may have some sort of system in place.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:27-12:28
But it it really just varies.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:28-12:36
But yeah, sometimes it is riding up to ten times running up and down a slide tower, and it does get very time consuming because what it is, it's like

Alex Ojeda: 
12:35-12:48
You know, I'll film something, I'll review it, and then I'll be like, oh, wait, maybe this angle would look better, or this, or maybe you have a vision for something because beforehand, when I'm pre-planning, it maybe looks crazier in person if I do XYZ different angle.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:48-12:54
Maybe flying the drone from a back angle, maybe a different, you know, like you're saying, for in that example that you saw, it was actually in the Netherlands.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:54-12:57
I had taken off my shirt.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:56-12:58
Because body slides are faster without a shirt on.

Alex Ojeda: 
12:58-13:02
So I had written the slide with the shirt and I said, wait, I can go way faster without the shirt.

Alex Ojeda: 
13:02-13:04
So that's going to do better the content.

Alex Ojeda: 
13:05-13:15
There's little things like that that we're always like, kind of like playing around with and trying to see how we can make this look incredible or even more incredible than what it actually is, or bring that experience to life.

Alex Ojeda: 
13:16-13:17
Because what it is, is like.

Alex Ojeda: 
13:17-13:18
Taking the viewer on the experience.

Alex Ojeda: 
13:19-13:28
If the viewer feels like all the emotions that you're feeling on the attraction, that's what's going to make the content actually come to life and then invoke that like emotional

Alex Ojeda: 
13:27-13:28
draw and investment with a viewer.

John Pendergrast: 
13:29-13:30
Yeah, that's really cool.

John Pendergrast: 
13:30-13:35
I'm going to I'm going to finally let Tim say something because apparently I'm just dominating conversations.

Tim Samson: 
13:37-13:37
That's okay.

Tim Samson: 
13:38-13:38
It was a good conversation.

Tim Samson: 
13:39-13:40
I was going along with that.

Tim Samson: 
13:40-13:48
But you you mentioned something you mentioned something a while back about hiring a social media manager

Tim Samson: 
13:46-13:49
And I think that that's important, and a lot of attractions are doing that.

Tim Samson: 
13:50-13:55
I see most of them fail because they hire someone who's good at their personal social media.

Tim Samson: 
13:55-13:59
And you've talked a lot about content creation and being strategic about it.

Tim Samson: 
14:00-14:02
and and really thinking through what that means.

Tim Samson: 
14:03-14:08
So I think about kind of the missteps and that other attractions have done with this.

Tim Samson: 
14:08-14:14
I don't know how many times I've seen an attraction that always has just images of teenagers when it's really a family attraction.

Tim Samson: 
14:14-14:14
Right.

Tim Samson: 
14:15-14:21
Because the person who's doing their social media is getting all their friends to come up, and that's the thing that they're in.

Tim Samson: 
14:21-14:25
So, from the perspective of working with attraction.

Tim Samson: 
14:25-14:26
You're twofold.

Tim Samson: 
14:26-14:29
You're both a consultant and a content creator.

Tim Samson: 
14:29-14:29
Right.

Tim Samson: 
14:30-14:36
What do you think attractions get wrong within that space, both doing it themselves and working with the creator?

Alex Ojeda: 
14:36-14:42
Yeah, I think the biggest thing is that there shouldn't be any personal preference to anything done on social media.

Alex Ojeda: 
14:42-14:50
It should all be backed by: you know, how are we making the greatest piece of content possible and how are we making the content that's

Alex Ojeda: 
14:49-14:50
Going to do two things.

Alex Ojeda: 
14:50-14:55
One, get people through the door in the attraction space, and two, actually perform and draw eyeballs.

Alex Ojeda: 
14:55-14:59
Because the way I see it is like

Alex Ojeda: 
14:57-15:04
The more eyeballs on these social media channels, the more percentage of people we can try to convert to getting people through the door.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:04-15:10
And so, what happens a lot of time that I see is there's people

Alex Ojeda: 
15:07-15:14
They're doing what they think they need to do, or they're, you know, just taking what they may know and say, Okay, this trend is really fun.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:14-15:16
I want to do that because it looks fun.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:16-15:19
Or, hey, this idea, they're doing it for personal reasons and they're not doing it.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:19-15:23
For, you know, they're doing it more because that's what they like to do and not what actually works for the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:24-15:30
And so a lot of times, like when I'm working with my specific clients, they'll have a coordinator that

Alex Ojeda: 
15:29-15:34
Maybe a little frustrated by me being like, hey, we need to reshoot this, or hey, we need to do this a different way.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:34-15:38
But in the, you know, I'm always reiterating, like, hey, this is not for personal preference.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:38-15:41
This is just what's going to drive the highest engagement possible.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:42-15:47
We need to film something this way, or we need to do this specific video because here's the track record.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:47-15:54
And we'll always refer back to a piece of content that's similar, or that another park has done, or another creator has done and said, hey, look, this is the track record.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:54-15:55
Here's this trend.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:55-15:57
Here are ten videos that I've done really well recently.

Alex Ojeda: 
15:57-16:01
Here's how we can integrate it and make it even better than how this person did it.

Alex Ojeda: 
16:01-16:04
And we're always doing stuff like nothing's personal preference, essentially.

Alex Ojeda: 
16:04-16:10
And so that's kind of where we see a lot of attractions kind of

Alex Ojeda: 
16:09-16:16
Unfortunately, lacking is in those areas because they do things for personal reasons, not backed by other content examples and things like that.

Tim Samson: 
16:17-16:17
Yeah.

Tim Samson: 
16:17-16:23
And I think probably the second piece that I think we see a lot, at least from a

Tim Samson: 
16:22-16:29
from an executive standpoint or like the GM within the park is social media is so hard to attribute to actual revenue.

Tim Samson: 
16:29-16:36
So you do it to get people in through the turnstiles into the gate

Tim Samson: 
16:34-16:41
to eat at the restaurants, to do all these things, but it's really hard to measure because most of the time you're not purchasing a ticket or you're not doing certain things like that.

Tim Samson: 
16:42-16:46
Going a little bit off topic here, but

Tim Samson: 
16:44-16:52
How do you get the stakeholders how do you get the stakeholders on board to actually allocate funds towards this that it's difficult to attribute revenue to?

Tim Samson: 
16:52-16:58
And then what type of metrics do you use to really convey that back to say that we're successful in this?

Tim Samson: 
16:57-17:02
This is really driving the needle, even though there's not a direct attribution to it.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:02-17:02
Right.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:02-17:02
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:03-17:03
No, 100%.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:03-17:12
I think in traditional, or not necessarily traditional, but in the past, you know, parks are used to maybe a third-party marketing company or, um,

Alex Ojeda: 
17:12-17:20
A consultant come on and say, Hey, we're going to allocate, you know, let's say it's $100,000 in ad spend, and we're going to target these ads to your target market.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:20-17:24
And we're able to track that X amount of people clicked on our link through this ad and bought the ticket there.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:25-17:26
And then they can see that direct ROI, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
17:27-17:30
In organic marketing and social where everybody's just swiping, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
17:31-17:32
It is really difficult.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:32-17:40
To attribute exact like, hey, this video went viral, it got a million views, and out of this million views, you know, X amount of viewership went and actually purchased a ticket.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:41-17:42
It's almost nearly impossible.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:42-17:46
There are ways that, like, for example, at some of my

Alex Ojeda: 
17:45-17:47
What we'll do is like they have specific events, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
17:47-17:52
And we'll say, okay, the first time they hosted this event, we saw like 50 Seed the Past showed up for it.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:52-17:56
Then we posted this video promoting the event, and it did 800,000 views.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:56-17:59
And the next time the event came on, 850 season pass showed up.

Alex Ojeda: 
17:59-18:02
And you know,

Alex Ojeda: 
18:00-18:04
There was nothing else done differently besides that that one viral video did really well.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:04-18:12
So there's small cases like that where we can attribute to success or other things that we can attribute is like

Alex Ojeda: 
18:10-18:12
A lot of these parks and attractions have problems with staffing, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
18:12-18:15
Getting lifeguards, getting people to man the attractions.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:15-18:16
Um, and it's always short-staffed.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:16-18:21
And so, um, having these incredible videos, what it does is it not only brings guests into the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:21-18:29
They're seeing success in people seeing how fun the park is and seeing how fun the work environment is, and it's helping solve some of those staffing issues.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:29-18:32
And they can attribute that to not, you know, hey, last year we had this exact same issue.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:32-18:34
We didn't have this social media presence or content.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:35-18:35
And now we do.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:36-18:40
Now a lot of our staffing is kind of a

Alex Ojeda: 
18:38-18:41
Kind of helped solve itself through that.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:41-18:44
But yeah, they're really, it's very difficult to kind of attract.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:44-18:48
All we can kind of look at is like, hey,

Alex Ojeda: 
18:46-18:47
We're looking at comments.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:48-18:50
So, like if a video goes viral, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
18:50-18:52
We'll read it may have 300 comments on there.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:52-18:56
And out of those 300 comments, the people who are typically commenting are people within the area.

Alex Ojeda: 
18:56-18:59
And so

Alex Ojeda: 
18:57-19:06
So we can kind of like attribute if we did 100 million views throughout the summer and then let's say out of those 100 million views, I'm just throwing random numbers, let's say 1,000 comments, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
19:06-19:09
Then we can go in and we can assume

Alex Ojeda: 
19:07-19:15
And you can actually read the comments and say, hey, these are people locally engaging because they said, hey, I came here in the past, or hey, I live X amount away, or they're engaging with it.

Alex Ojeda: 
19:16-19:18
Maybe it's current guests, past guests, or people who didn't even know it existed.

Alex Ojeda: 
19:19-19:21
We're looking, we're measuring success.

Alex Ojeda: 
19:21-19:27
through the actual comments because we can actually attribute those to people who are in the driving markets and things like that.

Tim Samson: 
19:27-19:30
I mean, don't get me wrong, I think everyone knows they have to do it.

Tim Samson: 
19:30-19:30
Right.

Tim Samson: 
19:30-19:32
Like everyone knows they have to do social media.

Tim Samson: 
19:33-19:36
just part of the marketing landscape at this point.

Tim Samson: 
19:36-19:40
But it is it is difficult to kind of attribute that with it.

Tim Samson: 
19:40-19:46
I think as an industry again, going further off topic, so we're getting further and further down

Tim Samson: 
19:44-19:45
All right.

Tim Samson: 
19:45-19:48
But as an industry, I think sometimes on social media we want to curate things.

Tim Samson: 
19:48-19:52
And the story that's coming to mind is I'm sure that everyone has seen it.

Tim Samson: 
19:52-19:54
Probably everyone that's listening right now has seen this.

Tim Samson: 
19:54-19:58
The girl who's on the slingshot ride and the seagull lands directly on her, right?

Tim Samson: 
19:58-20:01
It hits her right in the face and goes for a ride with her up and down.

Tim Samson: 
20:02-20:05
So that happened at Morey's Piers, and it's when I was there.

Tim Samson: 
20:05-20:07
So it's kind of one of those things where it was the guest video.

Tim Samson: 
20:08-20:09
We waited for them to post it.

Tim Samson: 
20:10-20:15
But in a traditional sense, like an attraction would not post that video, right?

Tim Samson: 
20:15-20:20
Because it really kind of goes against everything that they're striving for.

Tim Samson: 
20:20-20:23
Even though it's this weird freak accident, right?

Tim Samson: 
20:24-20:26
So it doesn't portray it in the the best light.

Tim Samson: 
20:26-20:29
And where I'm really going with this is authenticity.

Tim Samson: 
20:29-20:31
I was having this conversation last night at dinner.

Tim Samson: 
20:32-20:35
With a photographer and a guy from an agency.

Tim Samson: 
20:35-20:40
And we were talking about the ability for the industry when they're taking photos of coasters to have everyone with their hands down.

Tim Samson: 
20:40-20:40
Right.

Tim Samson: 
20:41-20:45
So everyone has their hands in because we're safety first, and that's the thing that we do.

Tim Samson: 
20:45-20:48
But that's not how people ride roller coasters, right?

Tim Samson: 
20:49-20:56
So there's a balance between authenticity and kind of sticking to your core values

Tim Samson: 
20:55-21:00
And I think sometimes that's difficult to get in social media because someone can tell instantly if something's not authentic.

Tim Samson: 
21:01-21:06
So any words of advice to people like

Tim Samson: 
21:04-21:04
How do you balance that?

Alex Ojeda: 
21:05-21:11
Yeah, I think in my head, it's it's managing a fine line between being authentic and legal and safety.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:11-21:15
I'm always in favor of being authentic a thousand percent.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:15-21:18
And not only legal and safety, but also like upsetting guests, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
21:18-21:22
Because in my head, it's like I want to 100% of the time go out of the box with ideas.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:23-21:29
If I see a hate comment, I want to, you know, flip it around and actually make a video on it and take things.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:30-21:33
And really be as authentic as possible and just be real.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:33-21:37
But obviously, in some cases, it could upset guests and portray a negative light.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:37-21:40
And then we're having issues where guests don't want to come to the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:40-21:44
Or it could be a safety thing, like you mentioned, with, you know, hey, everybody throws their hands up.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:44-21:48
So we're going to do this trend where we throw their hands up, and then maybe it is a legal safety thing.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:49-21:52
And so I'm always trying to like

Alex Ojeda: 
21:50-21:55
You know, scrape that fine line and making sure we're not crossing it, but taking advantage of it as most as possible.

Alex Ojeda: 
21:55-22:03
And so, a good example of this: one of my clients is down in Mississippi, and one of their neighboring parks said, you know, it's still the same management company.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:02-22:04
But they decided not to open the other park that summer.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:04-22:07
And so, in the market, those are the two water parks in that market.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:07-22:12
And so, this is the Gulf Islands water park down in Mississippi, and the other water park in the market is Blue Bayou.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:12-22:14
And so

Alex Ojeda: 
22:12-22:14
They're both managed by the same company.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:14-22:17
But one of the things we did is we noticed Blue Bayou is not going to open this year.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:17-22:22
So we're being authentic and we made content that was like, hey, Blue Bayou's not open.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:22-22:23
But we're here all summer.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:24-22:26
And so what that did is that content went viral.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:26-22:31
It hit everybody who typically goes to Blue Bayou, and they said, Wow, okay, Blue I didn't know Blue Bayou wasn't going to open.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:31-22:34
I think that video had like seventy seven thousand likes or somewhere around that.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:34-22:37
It went crazy on so on on TikTok and Facebook and stuff.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:37-22:42
And so we reading the comments, you know, there's people being like, oh, wow, I didn't realize you're also just a quick drive away.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:42-22:43
We're going to come.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:43-22:46
And then we saw a lot of those guests converting over.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:46-22:47
And that's just.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:47-22:58
A great example of being authentic, and then, like, kind of a horror story: a park in upstate New York that I work with, not necessarily a horror story, but this is kind of where I say I'm scraping that fine line: they were open for so many years and allowed coolers into the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
22:59-23:00
You could bring one in, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
23:01-23:07
ownership came, new ownership came and changed that rule because they said, hey, actually 99% of the parks in the U.

John Pendergrast: 
23:07-23:07
S.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:07-23:12
, there's the free cooler thing is no longer

Alex Ojeda: 
23:10-23:12
thing in the neighboring parks also didn't have that rule.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:12-23:16
So they s shi switched it where like, hey, if you have a season pass, you can bring a cool order.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:16-23:20
But if you're just a day ticket, that's not something we're

Alex Ojeda: 
23:18-23:23
Going to allow there was a lot of negative comments on social media through the park, just people complaining about that.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:23-23:25
So I said, Hey, how do we use that to our advantage?

Alex Ojeda: 
23:26-23:28
And we actually made content, you know.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:28-23:35
Filming someone trying to bring a cooler in and stopping them and saying, Hey, you need to get a season pass, or stopping them and saying, Hey, check out all the wonderful food in the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:35-23:37
Now, in social media terms, that was awesome.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:37-23:39
We're getting a lot of views.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:39-23:39
Great attention.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:40-23:51
But when you read some of those comments, especially on Facebook, we did see a lot of negative where scraping that line actually was leaning towards hurting us, even though we were getting a lot of new eyeballs on the park and actually educating the guests.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:51-23:54
On these things, that's an example of where it, you know, we had to take that content down.

Alex Ojeda: 
23:55-24:00
So it's kind of like aligning, in my head, we want to align guests' expectations so we eliminate those hate comments.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:00-24:03
So, for example, if your wait times are super long in your park, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
24:03-24:08
And your guest is going there with the preconception that your wait times are actually not that long.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:08-24:10
They get there, they have to wait in line, they're going to go comment a hate comment.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:10-24:14
But if we make jokes about the wait times,

Alex Ojeda: 
24:12-24:15
Guests see that they still come to the park because they see how fun the video is.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:15-24:18
They're expecting to wait in that line.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:18-24:20
And so we're kind of aligning those guest expectations.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:20-24:24
But again, we're managing that fine line and making sure we're not upsetting guests or.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:24-24:27
Or doing things but using those to our advantage.

John Pendergrast: 
24:27-24:28
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

John Pendergrast: 
24:28-24:38
And I can imagine when you're dealing from the park, you're going to have different levels of like park ownership being like, oh, hold on, this, this, this, like, there's a bad comment here, and you're going to go through that process.

John Pendergrast: 
24:38-24:39
How do you handle personally?

John Pendergrast: 
24:39-24:41
How do you handle the negativity?

John Pendergrast: 
24:41-24:42
Because there's like you're doing social media.

John Pendergrast: 
24:43-24:46
You've got to have an enormous amount of negativity coming across your desk.

John Pendergrast: 
24:46-24:53
I've listened to other interviews with different like influencers and they talk about kind of the impact of that negativity.

John Pendergrast: 
24:53-24:54
How do you handle that?

Alex Ojeda: 
24:54-24:57
Yeah, I mean, I've never honestly never been affected by negativity.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:58-24:59
I'm not sure what it was.

Alex Ojeda: 
24:59-25:04
When I first started creating, there was a ton of it because it was more personality-based versus what I do now.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:04-25:09
I use the analogy that I'm kind of like the weatherman, where like I'm just the credible figure, you know, telling you the weather.

Tim Samson: 
25:09-25:11
I'm giving you kind of look like a weatherman.

Tim Samson: 
25:11-25:13
You could really pull this off.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:15-25:17
But you're never hating on the weatherman, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
25:17-25:21
You may comment on, like, for example, in my case, they're never hating on me.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:21-25:24
They may hate on the experience, like, oh, that looks super boring or whatnot.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:24-25:27
So for me,

Alex Ojeda: 
25:25-25:26
It never affected me personally.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:26-25:31
Now, beforehand, when it was more personality-based, I did get a lot of hate directly targeted towards me.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:31-25:36
You know, I was also when I first started, was still in school and peers around me.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:37-25:41
And back then, it was not a normal thing or a desired thing to be on social media.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:41-25:42
It kind of like clowned on it.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:42-25:47
So, you know, I experienced negativity in person both

Alex Ojeda: 
25:45-25:46
On social media and stuff.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:46-25:52
But honestly, I again, when I have that bigger purpose, and there's nothing you can kind of tell me that will actually upset me.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:52-25:54
And in contrast, it'll actually motivate me to do more.

Alex Ojeda: 
25:54-26:00
And so in the attraction space, though, when we're getting hate comments, like I said, in my head, it's like,

Alex Ojeda: 
25:59-26:01
How do we leverage those to our advantage?

Alex Ojeda: 
26:01-26:11
Kind of similarly, as long as we're not upsetting the guests even more and we're actually like flipping the narrative or kind of playing it off as a joke, that's where we're actually seeing

Alex Ojeda: 
26:10-26:15
more success and take using it to our advantage as opposed to like, hey, this is a bummer.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:15-26:24
Or in my client's perspective, this is a great way to like take this as like kind of guest feedback and kind of getting a lot of guest feedback like, hey,

Alex Ojeda: 
26:24-26:27
The soda machines at this location in the park are super disgusting.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:27-26:31
And the guest is posting a comment, and we're seeing that comment a hundred times.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:31-26:32
That's flagged to management.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:32-26:34
They're like, okay, we need to go do something about this.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:34-26:37
Whereas before, without social media, they may not have.

Tim Samson: 
26:38-26:39
Not even knowing.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:39-26:39
Exactly.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:40-26:41
We see a lot of that.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:41-26:47
And it also could be that there's certain things that people like, and it's not necessarily hate, but it's also their commenting.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:47-26:52
really good things about a specific thing that they like or what it might be an event or a policy in the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:52-26:58
Like, for example, when I mentioned the cooler scenario, you know, there was a lot of negative comments and the park can learn from those things.

Alex Ojeda: 
26:59-26:59
in those experiences.

Alex Ojeda: 
27:00-27:05
Whereas before, if we weren't creating that content or if the content wasn't as good and not reaching people, there would be no learnings to come from.

John Pendergrast: 
27:05-27:05
Yes.

John Pendergrast: 
27:06-27:12
So you've got a feed you've basically built a feedback loop in some sense that maybe didn't exist before, which is

John Pendergrast: 
27:11-27:11
Really helpful.

John Pendergrast: 
27:12-27:19
And that feedback loop obviously allows them to make even more content because they can use that to drive the next thing they want to say.

John Pendergrast: 
27:18-27:21
So, I've been a nerd my entire life.

Tim Samson: 
27:21-27:21
Definitely.

Tim Samson: 
27:22-27:23
If you needed to film, no one would have ever guessed.

Tim Samson: 
27:23-27:24
Yeah, I never would have guessed.

John Pendergrast: 
27:24-27:29
No, if you had to film in water, you found your camera and screw the camera lens over it.

John Pendergrast: 
27:29-27:30
You know, I got that.

John Pendergrast: 
27:30-27:31
That's how you did it.

John Pendergrast: 
27:31-27:33
And then everyone started using GoPros.

John Pendergrast: 
27:33-27:37
As I understand it, GoPros aren't the choice anymore necessarily, but at the time they really were.

John Pendergrast: 
27:37-27:41
You have like 360 cameras

John Pendergrast: 
27:40-27:51
So if you're a park and you're like, you know what, really appreciate working with influencers like you also want to do some more content ourselves, what's the kit that you're saying you should go and get?

Alex Ojeda: 
27:51-27:57
Yeah, I mean, obviously, like to your point of tech kind of emerging now, a lot of things are waterproof.

Alex Ojeda: 
27:57-28:00
So down down to the phone is water resistant.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:00-28:06
Yeah, I mean, it's honestly, you know, we're working with drones, we're working with the 360 cameras, we're working with the iPhones.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:06-28:09
We have nice microphones that we use.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:09-28:18
Outside of that, I mean, that that's really is the magic really comes from the phone and the microphones is is really where we're filming majority of our stuff.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:17-28:22
And then the drone and the three sixty cameras just allow us to B-roll or various ride shots.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:22-28:29
But yeah, really you you can you can cook with just a phone and and some microphones

Alex Ojeda: 
28:27-28:30
Does does App Do Apple and DGI sponsor you?

Alex Ojeda: 
28:30-28:32
Because I feel like that was like exactly what Apple wanted to hear.

Tim Samson: 
28:32-28:37
Our phone so good

Tim Samson: 
28:36-28:39
You can neither affirm nor deny that he did.

John Pendergrast: 
28:39-28:40
Yeah, exactly.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:41-28:43
Honestly, that's my unbiased opinion.

Alex Ojeda: 
28:43-28:45
I do work with

Alex Ojeda: 
28:44-28:50
Some of the action camera companies every now and then, but really just using the microphone and the phone is just authentically what's being used.

John Pendergrast: 
28:51-28:53
It's amazing how that technology has advanced.

John Pendergrast: 
28:53-28:55
Listen, I come from a time before cell phones.

John Pendergrast: 
28:55-28:57
I had one of the original Motorola.

John Pendergrast: 
28:57-28:59
Blocks kind of idea.

John Pendergrast: 
28:59-29:01
And back then I remember going, you know what would be really cool?

John Pendergrast: 
29:01-29:05
If they could put a camera in this device, this would be really cool.

John Pendergrast: 
29:05-29:07
And so now it's really I say I'm living in the future.

John Pendergrast: 
29:07-29:10
But there you go, showing my age.

Tim Samson: 
29:09-29:14
So your background is heavier, heavily in water parks, and the strategies apply across the industries, right?

Tim Samson: 
29:15-29:17
Within the verticals that we serve as a company.

Tim Samson: 
29:17-29:25
You know, there's zoos and museums, passenger vessels, ferries, railway, observation towers, water parks, kind of that whole thing.

Tim Samson: 
29:25-29:30
I think it's really easy for a water park or a theme park to be like, Oh, yeah, we're going to use social media for XYZ.

Tim Samson: 
29:30-29:37
But what are the kind of those universal things that can cross all the different attraction based industry

Alex Ojeda: 
29:36-29:45
Yeah, I think the number one universal thing is that every, regardless of what attraction you are, you already have fans, you already have your followers, you already have guests.

Alex Ojeda: 
29:45-29:50
And so a lot of the times what I'm doing is I'm working with a property that has been around for.

Alex Ojeda: 
29:50-29:54
I don't know, many, many years, and they've had hundreds of thousands of guests come every year.

Alex Ojeda: 
29:54-29:58
When we start creating content, that's our audience that can engage with our content.

Alex Ojeda: 
29:58-30:00
So we're never starting from fresh.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:00-30:02
Even when there's a brand new attraction, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
30:03-30:09
Usually there's some press or stuff that goes around it before it even comes out, or people are saying, Oh, this is new in XYZ City.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:08-30:16
Those people who are exposed to it, every attraction already has some sort of audience, whether you're a water park, zoo, doesn't matter what attraction you are, there's already some sort of audience.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:17-30:22
It's kind of universal to where if you just create something, there's already going to be an audience to engage with it.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:22-30:30
So now, if you create something good and you already have that audience to engage with it, that's where you see the engagement explode.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:29-30:41
So, a lot of the times, even with attractions now who don't have some high-level consultant or anything, or they are just creating, what you'll notice is like, sure, maybe not all their content is at that high level, but they may have

Alex Ojeda: 
30:39-30:41
A few videos that do reach these massive numbers.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:41-30:47
And that's simply because they filmed the trend really well, or they did this video really, this specific trend very, very well.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:47-30:49
And that audience kind of engaged with it.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:49-30:51
And those two things kind of made it explode.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:51-30:51
So.

Alex Ojeda: 
30:51-30:56
That's something that's very consistent between, regardless of what attraction is that there's already an audience to engage with content.

John Pendergrast: 
30:57-31:02
If I take that a little bit further and I say, okay, so you work in a market that's

John Pendergrast: 
31:00-31:02
Very kind of thrill-based, right?

John Pendergrast: 
31:02-31:05
Like, it's like, check out this water slide, it's the scariest water slide you'll ever be on.

John Pendergrast: 
31:05-31:09
I write it, I write it 10 times to get this video.

John Pendergrast: 
31:08-31:11
But like, there's also a lot more subdued attractions.

John Pendergrast: 
31:11-31:14
There's attractions that are like, here's a flower garden you can come walk through.

John Pendergrast: 
31:14-31:20
It's like, you know, unless it's going to turn into plants versus zombies, you're probably not going to have a really thrill-based environment.

John Pendergrast: 
31:20-31:23
is what you're saying here is that the same rules apply.

John Pendergrast: 
31:23-31:31
You're going to have an audience to that already, and you need to speak to that audience in a way that engages them, and you have to determine what that's going to be.

Alex Ojeda: 
31:30-31:36
Is that a thousand yeah, a thousand percent and even in the less exciting or less thrilling attractions?

Alex Ojeda: 
31:36-31:41
Like, you know, what we're always working on is called I call it like employee generated content.

Alex Ojeda: 
31:41-31:46
And that's where we're working with the staff to be on-camera personalities and kind of bring things to life.

Alex Ojeda: 
31:46-31:49
So, you know, it's not necessarily like only just showcasing attractions.

Alex Ojeda: 
31:50-31:53
We're doing a lot of fun stuff and building that environment.

Alex Ojeda: 
31:53-32:01
To kind of represent the brand through the employees, and so that doesn't necessarily have to come from the attractions, it can come from just you know, it doesn't have to come from something thrilling, essentially.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:01-32:02
Yeah.

John Pendergrast: 
32:02-32:11
Well, and we live in a increasingly increasingly where you're hearing more and more about AI and other things and those kinds of tools and what it can do, and yet it's missing that human connection, right?

John Pendergrast: 
32:11-32:13
Like it's

John Pendergrast: 
32:11-32:14
it's literally not the human connection.

John Pendergrast: 
32:14-32:23
And what you're saying is largely that you're instigating an opportunity to relate to the people that are at these facilities through the videos that you give.

John Pendergrast: 
32:22-32:27
Or that you create, and that gives people an opportunity to go, hey, I want to experience that.

John Pendergrast: 
32:27-32:28
That's the thing I want.

John Pendergrast: 
32:28-32:29
Total tangent.

John Pendergrast: 
32:29-32:34
But what do you think about the developing world of AI out there and what's happening in the market?

Alex Ojeda: 
32:34-32:37
Yeah, I mean,

Alex Ojeda: 
32:36-32:38
I'm not necessarily scared of AI at all.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:38-32:41
I want to use it to my advantage as much as possible.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:42-32:50
I don't see a world where AI is going to be like, hey, an attraction wants to make content or an influencer wants to make content, and AI will just

Alex Ojeda: 
32:49-32:50
Do it in two seconds.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:50-32:52
And I also see the platforms moving away from AI.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:52-32:57
Like I think YouTube just announced that they're not going to promote any content that's fully AI.

Alex Ojeda: 
32:57-33:05
So, where AI comes into my place is in like copywriting or in scripting or the pre-production and post-production.

Alex Ojeda: 
33:05-33:08
and kind of how to bring those things to life a little bit easier.

Alex Ojeda: 
33:08-33:15
That's where, you know, we're using tools like ChatGPT and things like that too, to kind of help us in the planning stages or the content ideation, things like that.

Alex Ojeda: 
33:15-33:22
Yeah, but when it comes to actually like creating the content, I think it's always going to be a success to physically get in there and be creating every day.

John Pendergrast: 
33:22-33:25
Well, I mean, there's

John Pendergrast: 
33:24-33:25
Constant noise in this area.

John Pendergrast: 
33:25-33:29
So Will Smith, I don't know, you might be are you young enough or old enough to know who Will Smith is?

John Pendergrast: 
33:29-33:35
Yeah, so Will Smith just released his his video of his new album tour.

John Pendergrast: 
33:35-33:39
And it very quickly became apparent that the entire audience was AI.

John Pendergrast: 
33:39-33:41
And you're now he's dealing with all the fallout of that.

John Pendergrast: 
33:42-33:44
So it's just interesting to watch how the market shifts.

John Pendergrast: 
33:44-33:44
I would agree with you.

John Pendergrast: 
33:45-33:47
I think

John Pendergrast: 
33:45-33:48
AI is an incredible tool for things like copywriting and those kinds of things.

John Pendergrast: 
33:49-33:53
But for the actual content creation, I don't see you're going to run into any problems any time soon from that perspective.

Tim Samson: 
33:54-33:55
It's just iterating, though.

Tim Samson: 
33:55-33:57
Like it's all iteration.

Tim Samson: 
33:56-33:57
With AI.

Tim Samson: 
33:57-33:59
Like, it can't create.

Tim Samson: 
33:59-34:02
And I think that's the important thing with social: you're creating.

Tim Samson: 
34:02-34:08
So it can copy someone else's idea or do something, but you could quickly miss that authenticity.

Tim Samson: 
34:08-34:11
Say the Human Rights Museum in Winnipeg, which is an awesome museum.

Tim Samson: 
34:11-34:13
If you're ever there, you need to go.

Tim Samson: 
34:13-34:13
Right.

Tim Samson: 
34:14-34:18
Say they were to ask about

Tim Samson: 
34:17-34:26
how to create a social media campaign, there's a very good chance that what it's going to come back with is not relevant to that particular subject matter.

John Pendergrast: 
34:26-34:26
Sure.

John Pendergrast: 
34:26-34:26
Right.

Tim Samson: 
34:27-34:27
At all.

Tim Samson: 
34:27-34:34
I think the AI is incredible for helping with that pre-production, but it lacks the humanity.

Tim Samson: 
34:34-34:34
Right now.

Tim Samson: 
34:34-34:35
At least right now.

Tim Samson: 
34:35-34:35
Maybe we'll.

John Pendergrast: 
34:36-34:39
I kind of hope we don't, but but yeah, you know, possibility.

John Pendergrast: 
34:39-34:47
I think the human connection thing, where AI thrives, I think, is the ability to create the content that enables

John Pendergrast: 
34:45-34:47
human connection between humans, right?

John Pendergrast: 
34:48-34:57
And when you skip that step and go straight to AI to human connections, we run into some really weird stories and things that we probably don't want from a cultural perspective.

John Pendergrast: 
34:56-34:57
So cool.

John Pendergrast: 
34:57-34:59
A little bit of an aside, but that I'm just always curious.

John Pendergrast: 
35:00-35:03
Um I have kids that aren't a lot younger than you.

John Pendergrast: 
35:03-35:04
Uh one of them's twenty three.

John Pendergrast: 
35:04-35:11
And um that generation tends to really dislike AI and wants to be authentic and AI couldn't be less authentic.

John Pendergrast: 
35:11-35:12
So it's just interesting.

John Pendergrast: 
35:12-35:14
I was just curious about your feedback there.

John Pendergrast: 
35:15-35:21
Kind of getting back on script: how do attractions build like sustainable content strategies?

John Pendergrast: 
35:21-35:23
Versus becoming dependent on yourself.

John Pendergrast: 
35:23-35:24
Now, obviously, you're building a business.

John Pendergrast: 
35:25-35:31
You'd like them to be dependent on you, and from that perspective, but there's going to be a point where you're not scalable enough to service maybe everyone out there that way.

Tim Samson: 
35:31-35:33
That's where AI comes into play.

John Pendergrast: 
35:33-35:34
No, no.

John Pendergrast: 
35:34-35:37
That's where he inspires people and teaches them how to do what he does.

Tim Samson: 
35:37-35:38
Yeah.

John Pendergrast: 
35:38-35:43
So what's the path to developing internal capabilities that can be augmented by people like yourself?

Alex Ojeda: 
35:44-35:55
Yeah, I think the biggest thing is honestly, it's what my whole consulting is is based off is building an in house system for daily content creation.

Alex Ojeda: 
35:55-36:00
And the simplest answer to that is like for any attraction to just start out by hiring that role.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:00-36:04
If it is a social media intern, a social media coordinator, whatever it might be.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:05-36:07
and just get creating as much as possible.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:07-36:16
Even if it isn't daily, it's like they they need to be posting because as we discussed before, like everybody is on their phone, no matter who it is, everybody's swiping.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:16-36:18
And so it's like, how do we reach people?

Alex Ojeda: 
36:18-36:20
How do we get in front of the people who are swiping?

Alex Ojeda: 
36:20-36:22
And that's by creating content.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:22-36:28
So, what essentially, like, where I come in is, you know, I have eight

Alex Ojeda: 
36:26-36:34
Eight to nine years of experience of just creating and really doing short-form video first and leveraging it to the max.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:34-36:40
It's kind of like making sure that every piece of content that is shared is being optimized.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:40-36:53
To be the best piece of content possible, so that we're reaching and getting the numbers that we want, which, in some clients' cases, you know, last summer we had to park to 130 million plus impressions across the summer, so it works out really well.

Alex Ojeda: 
36:53-37:04
Now, the only difference is like if a park were to just go hire a social media coordinator, again, it it's just that every piece of content, again, is not going to be done off of that

Alex Ojeda: 
37:03-37:05
kind of personal preference that I was telling you about.

Alex Ojeda: 
37:05-37:10
It may go down that route as opposed to being all done like in best practices for the algorithms.

John Pendergrast: 
37:10-37:12
So I'm kind of reading between the lines.

John Pendergrast: 
37:12-37:13
And tell me if I'm wrong here.

John Pendergrast: 
37:13-37:17
But what you're saying is you have seven to eight years of experience of

John Pendergrast: 
37:16-37:26
Or more of trying things and determining over time what works, which means you've probably thrown a lot of things at the wall to figure out what sticks

John Pendergrast: 
37:24-37:24
Yes.

John Pendergrast: 
37:24-37:25
And you've learned that process.

John Pendergrast: 
37:26-37:27
Now it's kind of instinctual.

John Pendergrast: 
37:27-37:33
So, what your initial statement I think is to say, go start creating content, go start throwing things at the wall.

John Pendergrast: 
37:33-37:36
Most of it's probably not going to stick, but then you'll have one that does stick.

John Pendergrast: 
37:36-37:37
And then you can start to build those.

John Pendergrast: 
37:37-37:48
So is what you do then from a consultancy standpoint is to try and help some of those people fast track into here's the ten things that I've learned

John Pendergrast: 
37:47-37:50
That work at least in broad scopes.

John Pendergrast: 
37:50-37:52
And here's how you can start to define those for yourself.

John Pendergrast: 
37:52-37:57
So you can be authentically you, not just a copy of me from that perspective.

John Pendergrast: 
37:56-37:58
Is that kind of what you're doing?

Alex Ojeda: 
37:58-38:03
Yeah, I think you, I think the analogy of throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks is a thousand percent.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:03-38:06
Yeah,

Alex Ojeda: 
38:04-38:09
Hitting the nail of, like, yes, we're it's if it's when you're doing things off personal preference, that's what you're doing.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:09-38:12
You're throwing stuff at the wall, and maybe things won't stick.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:12-38:14
So

Alex Ojeda: 
38:12-38:16
Now, you know, what I'm doing is like, okay, I've already gone through the trial and error.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:16-38:22
You know, I've done, I think, 2 billion views every single year for the last like five, six years across social media.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:22-38:24
And so it's like, now we're not doing that.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:24-38:25
It's all there's no personal preference.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:26-38:30
It's all just like, you know, these are the best practices across the board that work best.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:30-38:36
And then, you know, this is the current trends or the current content styles that are doing very well.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:36-38:42
And then how are we able to take the attraction at hand and leverage it into the trend or the content style?

Alex Ojeda: 
38:42-38:43
But you know, make it better.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:43-38:50
And so, yes, over the summer, what ends up happening is the coordinators at these parks start to learn more and more.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:50-38:52
And the teams, they learn, like, okay, this is what we have to do.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:53-38:54
Here's how we need to film things.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:54-38:56
And here's

Alex Ojeda: 
38:54-38:55
Kind of that alleyway.

Alex Ojeda: 
38:55-39:05
Now, yes, I am involved with some of these properties over a multi-year term because you know they want that consistency and they want to uphold that kind of like level of content.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:04-39:10
And I guess it's a lot more difficult to kind of like, hey, hand off the rings and, you know, go do it yourself.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:10-39:12
You know, unfortunately, it doesn't always work out that way.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:13-39:18
And they want to keep that high level of content because a lot of the times

Alex Ojeda: 
39:16-39:19
What ends up happening is that they're only open for a certain amount of time.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:20-39:25
So there are attractions that are open year-round, but a lot of the ones that I work with are they only have like 90 days or 100 days of operation.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:26-39:28
So you really need to maximize that time.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:28-39:30
And they don't have the time to be throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:31-39:34
They want to make sure that every day is optimized and leveraged to its full potential.

Alex Ojeda: 
39:35-39:35
Yeah.

John Pendergrast: 
39:35-39:41
So it sounds to me like you're kind of heading towards, I mean, the one-off sponsored content is what you

John Pendergrast: 
39:40-39:43
Where you've kind of had a lot of your success to date.

John Pendergrast: 
39:43-39:53
But moving into strategic consulting, it's almost like you're heading towards what I can see you heading towards is actually a program of

John Pendergrast: 
39:51-39:58
Almost like guided mentoring or a mentoring program of: I'm going to teach you this is the way that you do these things.

John Pendergrast: 
39:58-40:01
Here's the program that you use to do that.

John Pendergrast: 
40:01-40:11
And you're essentially building like I'm thinking about there's programs like this inside of sales that are like predictable revenue is one of these kind of groups that does this, where you're building a training program

John Pendergrast: 
40:09-40:12
And you're building a way of thinking for people.

John Pendergrast: 
40:12-40:13
Is that at all accurate?

John Pendergrast: 
40:13-40:15
Is that kind of where you're headed in the long term?

Alex Ojeda: 
40:15-40:23
Yeah, I just think it's obviously showing you the robots, but it's also what I do is I hold your hand and walk you through the flashlight.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:23-40:24
Exactly.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:24-40:28
So 'cause in the past, I've spoken at all the conferences.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:28-40:35
I've spoken at both industry conferences with IAPA and WWA, and I give a lot of

Alex Ojeda: 
40:33-40:33
Free value.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:33-40:35
Like, I've never, like, I've never tried to hide.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:35-40:39
I could sit here and tell you everything, just like I said, hey, everybody needs to be posting, everybody needs to be creating.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:39-40:43
But where I saw and why my consulting business actually came to life is because.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:43-40:44
People are like, this is amazing.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:46-40:50
We love this information you're telling us, but we need an accountability aspect integrated to it.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:50-40:55
And not only that, again, like I mentioned before, we only have X amount of days of operation.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:55-40:56
We don't want to be.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:56-40:59
Just floating around and sending someone to just go mindlessly make content.

Alex Ojeda: 
40:59-41:06
Like, we need this plan, we need this strategy, and we need to be milking the most amount of views we can in this short amount of period of time.

Alex Ojeda: 
41:06-41:09
And so it's kind of like

Alex Ojeda: 
41:07-41:14
A mixture of the time sensitiveness and the accountability is where I really come in and help them strive, because I can give all the knowledge in the world.

Alex Ojeda: 
41:14-41:15
Sure, as matters.

Alex Ojeda: 
41:16-41:16
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
41:16-41:22
And so that's where that's where I was seeing and why there was a lot of interest in what I was doing is because

Alex Ojeda: 
41:21-41:30
you know, I gave all this free value, but then the accountability aspect and the time sensitiveness is like, wow, we really want to take advantage of this.

John Pendergrast: 
41:30-41:32
So how do the economics vary on that?

John Pendergrast: 
41:32-41:35
Like the economics of economics of one off sponsored content makes sense.

John Pendergrast: 
41:35-41:37
You're you're negotiating a a price for that.

John Pendergrast: 
41:38-41:44
The other stuff is much more of a long term and you're holding people's hands and you're walking them through these things and you're kind of guiding them and and mentoring them in some sense.

John Pendergrast: 
41:44-41:46
How do the economics work differently on that?

John Pendergrast: 
41:46-41:54
Because, like, clearly, one of them has a much longer-term value to you, which is that mentoring side, of course, is going to be the long-term value.

John Pendergrast: 
41:55-41:58
And at some point, I mean, I can only imagine you're going to make content.

John Pendergrast: 
41:58-41:59
Until you're my age, I'm sure.

John Pendergrast: 
42:00-42:01
Because I think it's in your blood.

John Pendergrast: 
42:01-42:04
But also that mentoring side is going to be where you're probably going to get the biggest value.

John Pendergrast: 
42:04-42:07
So how does the economics work differently in your head for those?

Alex Ojeda: 
42:07-42:13
Yeah, I think obviously like my one off sponsored post, and even even when I'm I'm also

Alex Ojeda: 
42:13-42:19
Straying away from that and trying to build more meaningful partnerships on my content on my personal brand side.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:19-42:22
So, for example, I used to do one off partnerships with the cruise line with Royal Caribbean.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:23-42:27
Now I work with them as a global creator ambassador, multi-year contracts, like

Alex Ojeda: 
42:27-42:30
I'm helping other opportunities, like designing that water park.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:31-42:31
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:31-42:35
You know, I'm always looking for more meaningful partnerships, or even I work with tourism boards, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
42:35-42:42
In the past, they have been just those one-offs, but now it's like, hey, I'm working with them on a multi-year basis where I'll work with them this summer and the next summer.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:42-42:46
And when it comes to the consulting side of things, it's also kind of similar, I would say.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:46-42:50
Yes, it's a longer term where it's less of like a one-off visit or

Alex Ojeda: 
42:50-42:50
Yeah.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:50-42:52
No, there's there's obviously less travel involved, I would say.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:52-42:57
But I'm usually working on a three-month term with a lot of these properties or attractions.

Alex Ojeda: 
42:59-43:03
kind of like going on site once, doing the kind of the operational setups.

Alex Ojeda: 
43:03-43:08
I'm teaching obviously in person training, and then everything else I'm doing is remotely.

Alex Ojeda: 
43:08-43:10
So, you know, I'm still working every day.

Alex Ojeda: 
43:10-43:14
It's just less like on site than less travel, which is great.

John Pendergrast: 
43:14-43:16
I mean, travel is great until it isn't.

John Pendergrast: 
43:16-43:18
I've done enough in my life.

John Pendergrast: 
43:18-43:19
Yeah, no, I understand it.

John Pendergrast: 
43:19-43:20
And we're going to touch on this yet.

John Pendergrast: 
43:21-43:28
You kind of have the best of both worlds here because you're going to go on site, you're going to spend time at water parks, and I know your aspirations are to have your own water park someday.

John Pendergrast: 
43:27-43:39
So it's like you're training them in something and then also kind of ancillary getting training yourself in how these operations work and what works and what doesn't work, and don't put the drink machine there, and you know, like those kinds of things that you wouldn't get any other way.

John Pendergrast: 
43:39-43:41
So I you're kind of getting two advantages there.

John Pendergrast: 
43:42-43:46
Tim, you have a Royal Caribbean question, which actually ties really well off of what he just said.

John Pendergrast: 
43:47-43:48
jumping on that one.

Tim Samson: 
43:49-43:52
I feel like you might have answered it already, but I'll ask it anyway.

Tim Samson: 
43:53-44:02
So you were talking a little bit about, you know, relationship building and a Royal Caribbean CEO publicly credited you credited you with helping to shape the

Tim Samson: 
44:02-44:06
Perfect day Mexico waterpark vision, which is just super cool.

Tim Samson: 
44:06-44:06
It's huge.

Tim Samson: 
44:07-44:07
Right.

Tim Samson: 
44:07-44:12
So, like, from creator to, you know, we'll call you a social architect.

Tim Samson: 
44:12-44:13
That's going to be my title.

Tim Samson: 
44:15-44:16
You know, for attraction design.

Tim Samson: 
44:17-44:18
So, how did that even happen?

Tim Samson: 
44:18-44:23
Like, I know you said you've worked with them, but how do you build that level of trust at an enterprise?

Alex Ojeda: 
44:24-44:31
Yeah, so obviously it goes down to the core of my content, you know, being family friendly, being brand friendly.

Alex Ojeda: 
44:31-44:35
Being, you know, I guess follower first, where it's all value-driven.

Alex Ojeda: 
44:35-44:42
It's not necessarily about Alex Ojeda and like he's never flexing, like, hey, look at me, I'm on this cruise ship, and you're not.

Alex Ojeda: 
44:42-44:44
It's it's really all value-driven and story-driven.

Tim Samson: 
44:44-44:46
You're on a cruise step right now, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
44:48-44:49
I was yesterday, but I'm back home now.

Alex Ojeda: 
44:50-44:54
Um, but it is um

Alex Ojeda: 
44:53-44:55
It is kind of a value first thing.

Alex Ojeda: 
44:55-45:03
And so when a brand sees something like that, I feel like it differentiates me from the majority of the influencers who are maybe more personality-based.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:03-45:05
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:05-45:08
But it provides a lot more value to the brand.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:08-45:13
And so funny enough, the story with Royal Caribbean, I was actually just an organic fan of the brand.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:13-45:16
I've been cruising all the

Alex Ojeda: 
45:15-45:16
All my life with my family.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:16-45:19
And I just happened to be, it was actually my grandma's 75th birthday.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:19-45:23
I was on a cruise ship out of Alaska, and I saw someone with a production badge.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:23-45:29
Also, ironically, a week before that, an agency had reached out to me about a cruise

Alex Ojeda: 
45:27-45:30
Partnership opportunity with Royal Caribbean via email.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:31-45:36
And unfortunately, it didn't end up working out there, but I met them on site while just being an organic cruiser.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:36-45:38
And they recognize me and they're like, oh my God, we've seen your videos.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:39-45:42
Because I just asked out of curiosity, like, hey, do you do social media?

Alex Ojeda: 
45:42-45:44
And they invited me to dinner.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:43-45:46
That one dinner then turned into, hey, we would like to invite you.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:46-45:48
I think it was Odyssey of the Seas was launching.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:48-45:51
And so I went out there, and it was just a trade partnership at the start.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:51-45:54
They were like, hey, we just want to invite you, build a relationship with you.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:54-45:59
There's no expectation for deliverables, but we just want you to come enjoy and we love your content.

Alex Ojeda: 
45:59-46:04
And so I went out there and I shared

Alex Ojeda: 
46:02-46:03
A ton of videos.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:03-46:04
I tagged them in it.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:04-46:10
I shared how much I love the brand, and I also created content even though there was no expectation for it.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:10-46:11
So I went above and beyond.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:11-46:12
And they were super happy.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:13-46:14
That content performed really, really well.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:15-46:23
And then that then turned into my first one-off sponsorship with them for Wonder of the Seas, at that time was the world's largest cruise ship.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:24-46:28
And then it just so happened that other cruise lines saw the content.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:28-46:30
They were very interested in working with me.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:30-46:35
And while I love the industry as a whole, in my heart, it was really with Royal Caribbean.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:34-46:42
And so I, just through conversations with them, they were just like, hey, we, you know, we appreciate you for letting us know.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:42-46:44
We'd love to continue our relationship.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:44-46:47
And so we then I ended up doing another one-off with them.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:47-46:50
And then on that one-off, we discussed doing a year partnership.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:50-46:52
Which they I don't think they had done with other creators.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:52-46:58
And so myself and one other creator got on this year contract, and we did a really great job.

Alex Ojeda: 
46:58-47:00
And then they renewed us for year two.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:00-47:08
And then it just so happened that in between those two, the product team had been following all this content that I was sharing with the brand and took note of me.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:08-47:14
And they loved that I, you know, kind of had that global light and also

Alex Ojeda: 
47:13-47:18
Kind of like what you were saying, is that I've kind of learned from the feedback of my audience what they like or what they don't.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:19-47:21
I heard,

Alex Ojeda: 
47:20-47:27
That Michael Bailey, the CEO, was in a meeting and that they had proposed to him some slide designs, and that he was like, Would Alex ride these?

Alex Ojeda: 
47:28-47:31
And they were like, Well, let's ask him.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:31-47:33
And so that's when I got brought into the project.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:34-47:39
I went out for a day to the Miami office and I just sat down with all the vendors and the product team.

Alex Ojeda: 
47:40-47:46
And we just went through slide by slide dissecting

Alex Ojeda: 
47:44-47:46
What makes sense to build?

Alex Ojeda: 
47:46-47:46
What doesn't?

Alex Ojeda: 
47:47-47:49
How do we think of like a social first kind of mindset?

Alex Ojeda: 
47:50-47:55
And also, like a modern and younger

Alex Ojeda: 
47:54-48:01
You know, everything at Royal Caribbean is still family first, but there's this big trend in young adults and what's trendy, and everybody's kind of moving towards that.

Alex Ojeda: 
48:02-48:05
And so

Alex Ojeda: 
48:04-48:05
It honestly just spawned off of that.

Alex Ojeda: 
48:05-48:17
And now the partnership is kind of evolving into more less of like just a typical influencer collaboration to a meaningful longer term

John Pendergrast: 
48:16-48:17
Yeah, that's awesome.

John Pendergrast: 
48:17-48:23
And there's a takeaway there that I think so many people, whether you're an influencer or not, should take.

John Pendergrast: 
48:23-48:25
And that is that you're a founder.

John Pendergrast: 
48:25-48:30
And the thing that you did there, which is like

John Pendergrast: 
48:28-48:34
Every time I see someone who has that kind of drive, I try and find a way to hire them because, or at least work with them.

John Pendergrast: 
48:35-48:42
Because that point where you went, we have no arrangement

John Pendergrast: 
48:40-48:50
And I'm going to do a bunch of work, and I'm going to do something for this company or for this thing because I think it's an investment, and also I really like the brand.

John Pendergrast: 
48:51-48:52
But I'm going to do something.

John Pendergrast: 
48:52-48:55
And then that in turn pays enormous dividends.

John Pendergrast: 
48:55-48:57
But there was no guarantee that that was going to happen.

John Pendergrast: 
48:57-48:57
Right.

John Pendergrast: 
48:58-49:00
And that you, like you said, went above and beyond.

John Pendergrast: 
49:00-49:04
But that's the investment

John Pendergrast: 
49:02-49:02
part.

John Pendergrast: 
49:03-49:07
You're investing in yourself, you're investing in the potentiality of where this could all go.

John Pendergrast: 
49:07-49:10
And I think that's super inspiring.

John Pendergrast: 
49:10-49:16
And I think that's the piece that I pull out of that and go, that's what makes you so special is your willingness to go and

John Pendergrast: 
49:17-49:25
put online and  go get it done and work hard and take the bet on yourself that it's going to pay off.

Alex Ojeda: 
49:25-49:30
And I think if more people did that, we'd have more really cool things out there.

John Pendergrast: 
49:31-49:40
And so I think that congratulations, you've done an incredible job, and it's really cool watching your heel, how you've grown this thing.

John Pendergrast: 
49:40-49:41
I mean, look, 2.

John Pendergrast: 
49:41-49:45
whatever billion views, that's insane for the last few years.

John Pendergrast: 
49:45-49:46
So thank you. 

Alex Ojeda: 
49:46-49:48
Yeah, no, I really appreciate that.

John Pendergrast: 
49:48-49:51
Anyways, I'm sounding like my 50-year-old mentor self.

Tim Samson: 
49:53-49:54
Okay, that's all right.

John Pendergrast: 
49:54-49:56
Yeah, that's who I am.

John Pendergrast: 
49:56-50:00
So you want to open your own water park.

John Pendergrast: 
50:00-50:01
Now, have you picked a name?

Alex Ojeda: 
50:02-50:02
I have, yes.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:03-50:05
And are you allowed to say anything yet?

John Pendergrast: 
50:06-50:06
You don't have to.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:07-50:09
I haven't announced the name publicly ever, but.

John Pendergrast: 
50:09-50:11
Is this the exclusive announcement?

Alex Ojeda: 
50:12-50:19
I mean, it's not a secret by any means, but it is Ojeda Oasis Water Park is the name of the water park.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:20-50:22
Yes, and I'm not going to share.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:22-50:29
Too much more details outside of that until we're like official, just because I'm I'm one of those that like really wants to.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:30-50:34
you know, be serious and get things rolling before I make the full announcement.

Alex Ojeda: 
50:34-50:40
But that is the yeah, that is the dream and the goal here, and something that I'm working for in the next couple years.

John Pendergrast: 
50:40-50:41
That's amazing.

John Pendergrast: 
50:42-50:43
You know, I wish you all the best on that.

John Pendergrast: 
50:43-50:46
That's truly a spectacular goal.

John Pendergrast: 
50:46-50:52
And when I think about where your family came from and

John Pendergrast: 
50:50-50:56
What your dad did and the effort he put in, and now he has a son pushing as hard or harder going after those things.

John Pendergrast: 
50:56-51:00
And the culmination of that is

John Pendergrast: 
50:59-51:05
The first of what I likely expect to be many water parks, because I can't imagine you stopping at one.

John Pendergrast: 
51:06-51:09
There'll be an empire yet before you're done.

John Pendergrast: 
51:09-51:10
That's huge.

John Pendergrast: 
51:10-51:11
And congratulations.

Alex Ojeda: 
51:11-51:12
I appreciate it.

Alex Ojeda: 
51:12-51:13
Big deal.

Tim Samson: 
51:13-51:15
And probably a cruise ship.

Alex Ojeda: 
51:15-51:16
Right.

John Pendergrast: 
51:19-51:21
There's going to be a real Caribbean water park.

Tim Samson: 
51:21-51:22
This is one water park.

Tim Samson: 
51:22-51:23
There's no rooms.

Tim Samson: 
51:24-51:29
Yeah, so you're you know, the your evolution has been pretty cool overall.

Tim Samson: 
51:29-51:33
I've known you for a number of years from

Tim Samson: 
51:31-51:36
creator to conference speaker to consultant, strategic consultant.

Tim Samson: 
51:36-51:36
It's really cool.

Tim Samson: 
51:36-51:42
You know, and if I can use the term like thought leader, like that's in my head, like that's where you are, right?

Tim Samson: 
51:42-51:44
And I think that most people would say.

Tim Samson: 
51:43-51:53
That so, and you're not just an influencer anymore, like you are, you are in a lot of ways, but as Jack Moore used to say, you know, you're more, you're more than you've become.

Tim Samson: 
51:53-51:54
Right.

Tim Samson: 
51:54-51:55
Like in general.

Tim Samson: 
51:55-51:57
Like there's lots of potential to do more.

Tim Samson: 
51:57-52:04
And I think with your water park and everything that you want to get out of life and grow this, it's really

Tim Samson: 
52:03-52:06
How important was the credibility shift uh on this journey?

Tim Samson: 
52:06-52:09
You know, influencer, content creator, speaker?

Alex Ojeda: 
52:09-52:13
I I think it I think it was

Alex Ojeda: 
52:11-52:15
The most important thing because I think when I first started, like I said, I was mindlessly creating.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:15-52:18
There was no end goal or there was no big end-all-be-all.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:18-52:20
I was kind of just like, hey, this is fun.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:21-52:22
Let's see where this takes me.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:22-52:23
I enjoyed creating this.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:25-52:27
And there was no like purpose or vision behind it.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:27-52:28
Right.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:28-52:35
And so I think all this credibility building just allows me to reach those bigger goals and continue my purpose and my why.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:36-52:43
Whereas, you know, if not, I would just be just an influencer and, you know, continue to reach a small group of people.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:43-52:45
and not be able to expand much outside of that.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:45-52:51
And so I think the credibility opens the doors to bigger opportunities, to bigger credibility building things.

Alex Ojeda: 
52:53-53:01
If you take the consulting with Royal Caribbean, for example, that's an example of that, where the credibility allowed me to

Alex Ojeda: 
53:00-53:05
Expand into, you know, doing consulting for a new water park.

Alex Ojeda: 
53:05-53:11
Like, that is not something that, you know, that is my dream and what I love doing, but it's not something that would have come if I just, you know.

Alex Ojeda: 
53:11-53:18
stayed as just an influencer or kind of like didn't go out outside of that and kind of build my industry expertise.

John Pendergrast: 
53:18-53:18
Totally.

John Pendergrast: 
53:19-53:20
I mean, the story is a great story.

John Pendergrast: 
53:20-53:24
And you're a young guy, so you have a lot of story left or right.

John Pendergrast: 
53:24-53:26
So that's really cool.

John Pendergrast: 
53:26-53:32
Okay, so we have this thing called Lightning Run, where we just ask questions and you answer them as we always say as quickly as possible.

John Pendergrast: 
53:32-53:36
But the reality is, neither Tim nor I are able to answer questions quickly.

John Pendergrast: 
53:37-53:38
Do as the best you can.

Tim Samson: 
53:38-53:44
The first time we tried this, the guest asked us questions and it took me like five minutes to answer one.

John Pendergrast: 
53:44-53:44
It's true.

John Pendergrast: 
53:48-53:49
Don't ask Tim questions.

John Pendergrast: 
53:49-53:53
That's the lesson that we're taking.

John Pendergrast: 
53:53-53:55
Okay, Tim, kick it off.

Tim Samson: 
53:55-53:58
Biggest mistake attractions make with social media. 

Alex Ojeda: 
53:59-54:01
Okay, I'm gonna have to think of these questions now.

Tim Samson: 
54:02-54:04
Come on, come on, chop, chop.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:04-54:11
Biggest mistake is just not, you know, I see a lot of photo-first content still where people are just posting stats.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:11-54:12
They have what.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:12-54:16
Photos on schedule, and they just post that all season.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:16-54:17
There's no video first.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:17-54:19
And like we said before, everybody's swiping.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:19-54:21
And when you're swiping, you don't see photos, you see video.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:21-54:23
So to me, that's the biggest mistake.

Tim Samson: 
54:23-54:24
Okay, let's try this again.

Tim Samson: 
54:25-54:25
John.

Tim Samson: 
54:26-54:27
These are lightning questions.

John Pendergrast: 
54:30-54:32
TikTok, Instagram.

John Pendergrast: 
54:32-54:33
Wait, Instagram.

John Pendergrast: 
54:33-54:34
Is it Insta now?

John Pendergrast: 
54:35-54:37
Anyways, TikTok, Insta, or YouTube?

John Pendergrast: 
54:37-54:38
Pick one.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:40-54:41
Oh, that's a tough one.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:42-54:44
I'm going to have to say YouTube.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:44-54:45
YouTube?

Alex Ojeda: 
54:45-54:46
Okay.

Tim Samson: 
54:46-54:49
Scariest water slide you ever filmed.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:49-54:51
Scariest water slide I've ever filmed.

Alex Ojeda: 
54:52-55:01
I don't know if there's one that specifically comes to mind, but in my head, that may not be the scariest, but I went to in Mexico, there's these slides called slip and flies.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:01-55:08
And you, it's kind of like a Nike check mark where you start on your, you're laying face first and you just fly into a pool.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:08-55:15
I think the very first time I, after doing it a bunch, I'm not scared of it anymore, but I think the very first time I did it, I was like,

Alex Ojeda: 
55:15-55:16
How is this real?

Alex Ojeda: 
55:16-55:17
Like, this is incredible.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:17-55:18
It was very scary.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:19-55:23
And it's very thrilling because you're launching crazy into the air and then you're just smacking into the water.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:23-55:24
It's so much fun.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:25-55:29
But I would say that first initial slide on that was very scary.

Alex Ojeda: 
55:29-55:31
So I think that's probably the scariest, or at least one of the.

John Pendergrast: 
55:32-55:36
That reminds me of this video I saw years ago of this lady going off one of those slides.

John Pendergrast: 
55:36-55:48
And then she's late she somehow managed to stay perfectly straight and hit the water, and the entire water park turned around because the that thing went viral.

John Pendergrast: 
55:48-55:49
Big time.

John Pendergrast: 
55:51-55:52
Vertical or horizontal video?

Alex Ojeda: 
55:53-55:54
I think vertical.

John Pendergrast: 
55:54-55:57
What's your grandma's current Fortnite skill level?

Alex Ojeda: 
55:58-56:01
Well, if she was still with us, I.

Alex Ojeda: 
56:01-56:02
I don't even know.

Tim Samson: 
56:06-56:07
God mode.

John Pendergrast: 
56:09-56:12
Oh, you're going to have to fix that in post.

John Pendergrast: 
56:14-56:15
God mode.

John Pendergrast: 
56:15-56:15
Wow.

John Pendergrast: 
56:18-56:19
Tad lighting round is over.

John Pendergrast: 
56:19-56:24
Yeah, it's

John Pendergrast: 
56:23-56:26
Oh, no, that's the tagline right now for this entire thing.

John Pendergrast: 
56:28-56:28
Okay.

John Pendergrast: 
56:29-56:32
Most overrated social media trend.

Alex Ojeda: 
56:33-56:36
Ooh, most overrated social media trend.

Alex Ojeda: 
56:37-56:40
Honestly, I don't have one that comes to the top of mind.

Tim Samson: 
56:41-56:42
Cruise ships or theme parks?

Alex Ojeda: 
56:42-56:47
If we're talking like theme park, theme park, like not water park, I'm going to have to go with cruise ships.

John Pendergrast: 
56:48-56:51
Drone footage, essential or overused?

Alex Ojeda: 
56:53-56:55
I view it as essential.

Tim Samson: 
56:55-56:56
Best time to post.

Tim Samson: 
56:57-56:58
This is a terrible question.

Tim Samson: 
56:58-57:01
Who came up with

Alex Ojeda: 
56:59-57:00
Not us.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:00-57:01
This is great.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:01-57:03
My answer to that, I get that asked a lot.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:04-57:05
It doesn't matter.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:05-57:08
My answer is it doesn't matter, but as long as people are awake.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:08-57:09
So, whatever your time zone is.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:10-57:12
If people are so if you don't go to bed till 10 p.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:12-57:12
m.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:13-57:14
, people are still awake till 10 p.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:14-57:14
m.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:14-57:16
So, or vice versa.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:16-57:18
I prefer to post in the morning because that's when everyone's awake, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
57:19-57:22
But that's my two cents on that.

John Pendergrast: 
57:22-57:23
Influencer or creator?

Alex Ojeda: 
57:24-57:25
Creator.

Tim Samson: 
57:25-57:28
Worst content collaboration you've ever seen.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:28-57:29
I've ever seen.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:30-57:30
Ooh.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:32-57:33
Communicator.

Tim Samson: 
57:33-57:35
Pizza Hut clone was bad.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:38-57:40
I don't, yeah, I also don't know if I have one.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:41-57:42
In mind.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:43-57:45
I have some good ones that I can think of.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:45-57:47
There's this little kid named The Rizzler.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:47-57:50
He's if you look him up later, he's super viral.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:50-57:51
He's just a funny little kid.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:51-57:53
He does like this funny face.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:53-57:54
And he went viral for that.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:54-57:56
And now I see like Hardy's Carls Jr.

Alex Ojeda: 
57:56-58:01
and them, they're working with him as like the face, or Arizona Ice T has him coming in as the face.

John Pendergrast: 
58:01-58:02
That's cool.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:02-58:04
Yeah, I don't know if I have any bad ones, though.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:04-58:07
I think that that's what Costa Man is like a good one that I've enjoyed recently.

John Pendergrast: 
58:08-58:10
I love the positivity.

John Pendergrast: 
58:09-58:12
Because you're every question we ask you, it's a negative-based question you turn around.

John Pendergrast: 
58:13-58:17
So, I'm going to ask you one more: one social media platform you'd eliminate forever.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:20-58:21
That's tough.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:21-58:29
I mean, I don't have one that I would eliminate, but I feel like I don't use Twitter enough to like in my day-to-day.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:29-58:32
So if I had to pick one, it would probably be Twitter.

Tim Samson: 
58:32-58:34
Most underrated attraction type.

Tim Samson: 
58:35-58:36
Content under any attract.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:36-58:41
Oh, I mean, I think it's like just going back to your core, your attractions.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:41-58:44
So, literally, just throwing up ride POVs.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:45-58:47
You know, I feel like it's not done enough, it's so underrated.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:47-58:52
Like, you know, if you go to any attraction, you won't see that most of the time.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:52-58:54
And so, I'm like, you know, why are people just going back to your core?

Alex Ojeda: 
58:55-58:56
Why are people coming back to your attraction?

Alex Ojeda: 
58:56-58:57
Like, I feel like.

Alex Ojeda: 
58:58-59:03
Is that like the most underrated, simple thing to just like immediately get good content?

John Pendergrast: 
59:03-59:05
Analytics or gut feeling?

Alex Ojeda: 
59:05-59:06
Analytics.

John Pendergrast: 
59:06-59:07
That's interesting.

John Pendergrast: 
59:07-59:08
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Pendergrast: 
59:09-59:10
I got to step in on this.

John Pendergrast: 
59:10-59:15
That's interesting because you're a creator, which is very, very right brain.

John Pendergrast: 
59:15-59:17
And then you're also very left brain.

John Pendergrast: 
59:17-59:26
I mean, I just like to always go off of data and I always look at the analytics and see what could I have done better the next time.

Tim Samson: 
59:27-59:29
Water parks in the off season?

Alex Ojeda: 
59:29-59:30
Yes or no?

Alex Ojeda: 
59:30-59:33
You mean you're talking like outdoor, indoor?

Tim Samson: 
59:34-59:36
Well, yeah, there is no there is no offseason in indoor.

Alex Ojeda: 
59:36-59:39
But yeah

Alex Ojeda: 
59:38-59:39
Outdoor weather.

Alex Ojeda: 
59:39-59:41
Like you're s I I yeah, I would love to see it.

Alex Ojeda: 
59:41-59:48
I mean, I I don't know if the other people would would be as crazy as I am to go out in freezing cold to

Alex Ojeda: 
59:46-59:53
To write some slides, but so like polar bird water parks, like Canadian style water parks, so yeah, that would be kind of cool.

Alex Ojeda: 
59:53-59:54
I think it's about content.

Tim Samson: 
59:54-59:57
Would you post content in your water park in the offseason?

Alex Ojeda: 
59:57-59:58
Oh, okay.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:00-01:00:01
Yeah, a thousand percent.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:02-01:00:06
I mean, obviously, when you're talking about like feasibility, it's a little more difficult.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:05-01:00:10
For some people, but 100% at my specific water park, yes, it'll be year-round content coming out.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:10-01:00:17
Even if there is no other offerings like hotel, campground, things like that, it would still be if it's just seasonal, it would still be content year-round.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:17-01:00:19
Got us all those season passes in the offseason.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:20-01:00:20
Yeah, totally.

John Pendergrast: 
01:00:21-01:00:24
Biggest content creation investment attractions should make.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:27-01:00:28
I heard this really great consultant.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:28-01:00:30
His name is Alex Ojeda.

John Pendergrast: 
01:00:32-01:00:32
Love it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:33-01:00:34
I would say that that's the biggest.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:34-01:00:40
I mean, in in general, it should just be

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:38-01:00:42
you know, investing into social first thinking.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:42-01:00:50
And so that starts with, like I said before, like just as simple as getting an intern or social media coordinator to start working out at the park.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:00:50-01:00:51
Yeah, it's that's awesome.

John Pendergrast: 
01:00:51-01:00:56
I love your take, too, because I had a mentor once say to me, if you're not willing to bet on yourself, why should anyone else?

Tim Samson: 
01:00:57-01:00:59
What's your content creation kryptonite?

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:00-01:01:02
What can you elaborate on what kryptonite means?

Tim Samson: 
01:01:03-01:01:04
What's the thing that you hate to do?

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:05-01:01:06
Oh, the thing that I hate to do.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:06-01:01:06
Okay.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:07-01:01:09
Ooh, that's tough.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:09-01:01:11
I mean, I enjoy pretty much every aspect of it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:11-01:01:15
I would say, like, my more favorite things are obviously being in the ground creating.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:15-01:01:24
The things that I am less excited about is kind of the, I guess, pre-planning and like figuring out actually where to go, coordinating the logistics of travel and things like that.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:24-01:01:28
That's kind of the more things where I'm like, you know, after a while, I'm like.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:28-01:01:29
I don't want to be doing this.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:29-01:01:36
I want to go create or I want to go plan out content as opposed to, like, hey, I need to fly to this destination to get XYZ or.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:36-01:01:37
whatever it might be, right?

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:38-01:01:44
So I think that's a better, I guess that's again, that's the thing I like the least, I guess would be the best way to phrase that.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:45-01:01:46
It's also nice.

John Pendergrast: 
01:01:46-01:01:48
That's the thing you can hire for if you need to.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:49-01:01:50
Yeah.

John Pendergrast: 
01:01:50-01:01:51
Next big social platform.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:52-01:01:54
Ooh, next big social platform.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:01:54-01:02:04
I don't know if there's like one specific platform, but what I do see is that, you know, there was a time where long for longer format content was king and everybody was flocking towards that.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:05-01:02:06
And then Short Form kind of took over.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:06-01:02:09
And while I still think Short Form is still going to be at the top,

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:09-01:02:11
I think long form is making its comeback.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:12-01:02:20
So if we're talking like YouTube shorts took over, I feel like YouTube long form is slowly going to start come back.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:20-01:02:28
You know, apparently there was some statistic that TV is a huge, huge, and even in my content, specifically, people are watching my YouTube long form on TV.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:28-01:02:30
It's like the biggest percentage sometimes.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:31-01:02:33
So I think when you talk about like.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:33-01:02:41
The next big thing, I think it's going to be that, you know, TV is coming back as well, and people are watching longer format content on television.

John Pendergrast: 
01:02:41-01:02:41
It's good.

John Pendergrast: 
01:02:41-01:02:43
Attention spans are starting to increase again.

John Pendergrast: 
01:02:43-01:02:44
That's good.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:44-01:02:44
Yeah.

Tim Samson: 
01:02:45-01:02:47
Best reaction you've ever gotten from a video.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:47-01:02:48
Best reaction.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:48-01:02:53
I mean, I my biggest

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:51-01:02:57
Like what I love the most is creating like some magical video for a brand that I'm work that I'm really passionate about.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:02:57-01:02:59
And then them going just crazy about it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:00-01:03:06
With Royal Caribbean, one of the my favorite videos I ever made was there was this trend going around where people would

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:06-01:03:10
Go into a restaurant and the waiter would be like, enjoy your food.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:10-01:03:12
And then the person would say back, thanks, you too.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:12-01:03:14
And the waiter would look back, be like, me too.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:15-01:03:16
And then it'd cut to them.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:16-01:03:20
Having shots of pizza or whatever the food was in together, and then they would say, Have a great day.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:20-01:03:23
The person would say, You too, and the waiter would be like, Me too.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:23-01:03:29
And then they would, you know, then show the guest doing the dishes and waiting the tables and stuff.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:29-01:03:34
And so I took this trend to the water park on Royal Caribbean's Island, and I did it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:34-01:03:35
It was like, have a great day at the water park.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:35-01:03:36
Thanks, you too.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:36-01:03:38
And then we montaged shots of us, having fun.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:38-01:03:41
And then it was like, you know, have a great day to the staff.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:41-01:03:45
And then, you know, I went back and I started like sending people down slides, lifeguarding and doing that.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:46-01:03:50
And that video, it just came out so well when I showed it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:50-01:03:59
to the director of social media at the time at Royal, she started tearing up of how like crying of how good it was and how like good it made her feel.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:03:58-01:04:02
And so for me, that this is probably one of the best reactions I've had from a video.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:03-01:04:11
And I personally love to see because it's like that satisfaction of two awesome brands coming together and building something

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:10-01:04:13
Or creating something magical, like that's the best reactions for sure.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:13-01:04:14
All right, the last question.

John Pendergrast: 
01:04:15-01:04:16
Content creation in five years.

John Pendergrast: 
01:04:16-01:04:17
What changes?

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:17-01:04:19
Oh, content creation in five years.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:19-01:04:20
What changes?

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:22-01:04:31
Honestly, I think what changes is content is just going to continue to get better and better because there's going to be so much content and so many people are starting to create more and more every day.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:32-01:04:35
And there's more and more platforms and it's more and more easier to create.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:35-01:04:39
that when you have so much content coming out, the only content that's going to succeed is the good stuff.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:39-01:04:45
So I think what's going to happen is it's like that phrase they say, like the great thing about America is competition.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:44-01:04:53
It's going to apply to content creation where content's just going to get better and better and better over the next five years to the point where to succeed, you really have to be good at it.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:53-01:04:55
Yeah, it's because everyone's going to learn your system.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:55-01:04:57
That's why it's going to get better and better.

Alex Ojeda: 
01:04:58-01:04:59
That's good.

John Pendergrast: 
01:04:59-01:05:02
Alex, it's been great having you with us today.
