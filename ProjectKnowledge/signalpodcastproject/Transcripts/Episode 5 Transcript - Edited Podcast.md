I think the biggest misconception is culture can't be changed or can't be formed. they just don't do anything to impact culture because they feel it's either too hard to change or it is the way it is.

if an organization does not have a detailed plan written down about how they're going to deliver service and achieve service, service delivery is not important to them.
