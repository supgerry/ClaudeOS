G
Gerry

Today, 5:04 PM
The other option is I just dropped a link in the chat that goes to Teams. And if Teams works, then we know that it's not you. It's Riverside.
Teams doesn't work, then probably like a deeper tech issue that like, we'll need to figure out and then maybe reschedule the call because don't know how long it might take. The figure it out. Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:04 PM
You can't you can't just log in to my computer and and check it out yourself?

TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:07 PM
Okay.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:08 PM
Excellent.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:08 PM
Minus the part where I see myself and Tim, this has been a fantastic experience so far. So if you wanna just close out the the Riverside for the time being. Just so we're not planning on two different things at the same time. This one
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:08 PM
we can keep
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:08 PM
And if you go and just minimize to your desktop for a second, Okay. Perfect.
If you click your start button, and just type I think what you let's type video. I think video will be it. Oh my god. Hold on.
Camera. Yeah. Text camera You should get an app that comes up with camera.
Yeah. Click on that. This is usually how I kinda go to the Windows version of what's going on and see if there's an issue there. So that's the easy note. That that's fine.
That's Windows trying to figure out where you work. Okay. Now I'm seeing that we have this block on So that's the video side. So I think that logo yeah. So that's the k. So is that is that That one from your laptop?
I don't have any audio from you.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:09 PM
I'm gonna I've asked you to unmute so I don't know if you can choose the mic
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:10 PM
Yeah. You look like you're muted in Zoom. Mhmm. You bring up again, you can unmute.
Yep. Oh, perfect. Is this camera that we're seeing you on here just your laptop camera?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:10 PM
Yes. Laptop
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:10 PM
camera.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:10 PM
Okay. Yep.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:10 PM
In your tray, like oh, by your clock, does the does that so the software that we're using here because I I have installed as well, Jerry. What is it called again? OCART? Something?
G
Gerry

Today, 5:10 PM
Ops.
Bot. Oz Bot. Yeah. That's the one.
Yours is a link. Controller, so it's, like, slightly different.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:10 PM
Oh, I see. Okay. I have a slightly different camera. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:10 PM
Can
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:10 PM
you look
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:10 PM
up
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:10 PM
that control panel? Like, is there an actual app there we can load up and take a look at?
Yeah. Yeah. So click on connect.
So this is what you're saying. And so if you unplug and plug back in again while it's on the screen, Okay. It's funny that the green light on the camera comes on. And it still doesn't see it.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:11 PM
So it's it's now turned on and flashing blue.
And green now.
K.
We got there.
Let's see. It's just it's on green, but it doesn't seem to be opening any of these windows, is it? No.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:11 PM
No.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:12 PM
Al, you're there's really two options here. I feel like, you know, one, is that, you know, you I feel like you set up your room really nicely. So that's an option. We could still Yep. That and the mic look very professional. So we could go with that. Or we could still, like, try to figure out the camera, like, to get it all set up. I'm okay. If you're okay, with the laptop camera. So I think it really, like, I'm I want option if comfortable this
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:12 PM
I'm comfortable, but does it change the quality of your production?
G
Gerry

Today, 5:12 PM
We are okay. I think we had Alex as well, and he was on on his iPhone camera.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:12 PM
Right. Action
G
Gerry

Today, 5:13 PM
was cutting off. So Yes. K. We're not really, like, you know, breaking anything.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:13 PM
Yes. So Yep. Yep. Like, what
G
Gerry

Today, 5:13 PM
do you think, John? Are you
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:13 PM
could meet back
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:13 PM

SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:13 PM
software. Okay. Alright. No problem.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:13 PM
And then so I'm selecting just the camera from the from the computer because that'll be
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:13 PM
automatically. Mhmm. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay. Will do.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:14 PM
One last thing before you click off the screen.
On microphone button, there's a little arrow that's pointing up. Could you click on that little arrow next to the mic?
Yep.
Perfect. You are using the right mic. Awesome.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:14 PM
Okay. Okay. Great.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:14 PM
Do you open the Riverside?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:14 PM
Alright. I'll see you there. Alright. Bye bye.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:14 PM
Hi, Tim. Thanks for waiting. We're coming back.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:14 PM
Tim, you've done the entire done the entire thing in our absence rate. Like, you got it all recorded. It's in the cam.
Oh, I can't hear you. What have I done wrong?
You told you forgot to tell me to unmute my mic is what you did wrong. Oh, no. I said I said I was rewriting the intro in my
G
Gerry

Today, 5:15 PM
Oh. Style. Okay. Yep.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:15 PM
So so we'll try it. If you don't like it, we'll do it the other
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:15 PM
way.
I want
G
Gerry

Today, 5:15 PM
so that's the most important thing.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:15 PM
Thanks, Perplexity. And then
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:15 PM
I Alright. So,
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:15 PM
Sean see you.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:15 PM
Like, so the camera is not coming on in in Riverside.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:15 PM
So
G
Gerry

Today, 5:15 PM
a permissions issue in Chrome where you let you know, turn on Riverside and you're like, hey. Give permission to the app. To use your camera.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:15 PM
Okay. Well, it hasn't asked for any of that. It just says Mike or Cam is in use by another app.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
You close
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:16 PM
Yeah. I closed Zoom. Yeah. It's everything's closed.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:16 PM
Okay.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
I think maybe what we do then, Sean, is the old restart scenario. If you restart the computer and then simply come back to this link, we can make one more crack at it before we have to reschedule for technical reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Which,
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:16 PM
by the way,
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
you are not the first guest for us to have to do this with. So I'm very don't don you would be the first guest that we reschedule because of
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:16 PM
the guest. No. No.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
Every other time it's been me. It's been it's been Tim. Yeah. That's
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:16 PM
true.
Alright.
Alright. So we're gonna restart the computer and then come back to Riverside. Mhmm. Just
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
straight to Riverside. That's
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:16 PM
correct. Okay. Alright. See you in a couple of
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:16 PM
two minutes.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:16 PM
Yes. Of course.
We're gonna have to do a decompression exercise after this so that we're all loose and limber for the the talk because I'm optimistic it will work. So
G
Gerry

Today, 5:17 PM
What's a decompression exercise? Like, I
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:17 PM
Well, so in my experience, whenever you deal with and so when I did film back in the day, you always had to, like, get the actors to, like, loosen up again. Whenever there's technical wait time, always had to get them to loosen up again because they get that they get in their heads, but they get in their heads. Right? Like, it's like stress goes up a little bit, and then all of a sudden, it just doesn't come up quite right. And so just kinda decompress everyone like a I don't know.
Icebreaker game kind of idea. But not quite like that.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:17 PM
Yeah.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:17 PM
I I I I haven't refilled my repertoire of dad jokes. Like, the last time
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:18 PM
You guys crow,
G
Gerry

Today, 5:18 PM
like, I gotta find a new one. The ones I have are all not safe for work or not appropriate. So I
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:18 PM
Well, you have all wait. They're dad jokes. Why wouldn't they be appropriate? What kind of dad jokes are you telling?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:18 PM
Okay.
G
Gerry

Today, 5:18 PM
Bad jokes. Bad jokes. That's prob
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:18 PM
Okay. Now it all makes more sense. That's good.
I'm looking forward to this conversation because I'm a I like culture, conversations. And I'm very curious, to learn
G
Gerry

Today, 5:18 PM
did your audio go? Out, or is it just me?
Let me try if a difference.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:19 PM

John Pendergrast

Today, 5:19 PM
The landscapers came twice today during Okay. So the last time we had a technical problem, it was Tim. And let me explain what had happened because this will make you feel much better about anything that happened
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:19 PM
on your computer. No. This is this is not the Tim
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:19 PM
in his infinite wisdom, decided to do something that tech people should know better. But Tim, you know, Tim's more art sometimes than science. And so he I'm trying to to install Mac's latest OS beta.
And and then was surprised as discover that it wasn't compatible yet with the hardware but we discovered that at point of recording.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:20 PM
So it wasn't so okay. That that is not a completely accurate thing. Right?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:20 PM
It's got all the important details.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:20 PM
The accurate story was the software worked in it. The visual background stuff did not. And I was at the apartment in Jersey, which has all kinds of baking crap behind me and is very messy. And and we put
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:20 PM
mask hair.

Alright. We're ready? I'm ready. I'm not ready. I can't watch you guys. I'm covering the camera. Okay.
Okay. Here we go. Got it. There's gonna be out of it takes. I can feel it already.
It's time to crank up our cultural IQ. Because today we're joined by none other than Sean McHugh. A guy whose name is basically a cheat code for how to fix guest experience, culture, and leadership when your staff flips faster than a roller coaster. If you've ever been to IOPA in the last decade, chances are you witnessed Sean and his natural habitat leading workshops, mentoring rising stars, and crafting training systems that actually stick. Even in the chaos of our industry. Sean's story started in the front lines of Australia's MegaPart but let's be real. He didn't stop there. He's been at the launch pad for Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi. See see, I messed up already.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Abu Dhabi.
I can redo this at the end, but in seared operations, I King Power Mehanakorn in Bangkok. Here's what sets Sean's apart. Sean apart. When most folks cross their fingers and hope culture just happens, Sean's out there with Blueprint blueprints and scaffolding, literally architecting the stuff everyone else dreams about. These days, he's the ringleader at attractions academy tackling the giant existential question our industry loves to ignore. How do you build a culture that lasts when half of your team is gone every six months? Sean's magic trick isn't about tech, rides, or trendy acronyms. It's about systems that make frontline staff deliver real memorable guest experiences year after year no matter how wild the staff turnover gets. Sean, welcome to Cigna.

Today, 5:25 PM
So But if I rerecord that in June, like, splices in, no one will know, and they'll have no reference for what you just sent. But
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:25 PM
like it. I like
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:25 PM
it.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:25 PM
Just.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:25 PM
So we were doing this recording earlier and I was I started this way to say, don't worry about what you say here, because the reality is is that we haven't grade a expert editor And at the beginning of our first podcast in episode one, I was watching it through. I'm like, this is great. I mean, Tim, she's cutting him perfectly. We're gonna get to me. I'm gonna have no cuts. It's gonna be great. And then it was like, every word was a new cut. I'm not even sure I said what she has me saying. Because it was so many cuts. And but anyways, we seem really professional. So everything you say here probably won't cut you at all, but us will cut lots. So we'll go from there.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:26 PM
So how
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:26 PM
we like to start these things?
Is to break them into kinda sections. And so have a little bit of method to the madness, started off with what we call part one and listen, from clown to consultant origins, there's, like, obviously, a history there. And so instead of asking well, no. Maybe I will ask this question. Sean, you've worn many hats in the industry even literally as a clown early in your career.
How did you get here and end up in training?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:27 PM
Oh my god. I don't know where you got this background information that yeah, I was a clown.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:27 PM
Situation?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:27 PM
We have really
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:27 PM
many, many years ago,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:27 PM
I was in the Moomba clan club. Moomba is is a Melbourne festival in Australia. And it's been going on for many, many years. They had a professional clown club, and I joined it because I wanted to be a clown.
And and I I I developed my own costume, my own name for my clown, and my own look. And I spent twelve months in training in these classes going every Moomba clan hub, and it it it suppose the big thing that we aim for was a parade that we had every year through the city. And I actually did the parade in my own costume as a clown. It's have no idea how you got that info. We ever swore just we never swore just.
Yeah.
So what was your question?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:28 PM
That was a that was a great political answer that that we asked a question, and then he reframed it. And now I don't even know. I'm gonna go back and read it.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
You've worn a lot of hats. It's it's being a out there.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:28 PM
How on earth did you end up as a trainer?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
Good question. Question.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
Well,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
I He wasn't he

No.

was very good at smiling as a clown, so that got me through the brave.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
But
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
He wasn't the
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
same.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
I I began
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
my career as
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:28 PM
a teacher. I primary school teacher. And and I was a good primary school teacher, or elementary teacher is to say in The USA. And I did that for about ten years. But I really didn't wanna stay in teaching For me, there wasn't enough diversity, and and so I'd always had my heart set on working in the the craze industry, really in the film industry where I could don't know, create a story or be part or be part of that creative process. And so theme parks for me it kind of just fell into place that theme parks is a place where I actually could actually have the contribution that was related to people and related to the environment and and and getting people ready to to deliver a great experience and and and tell a great story. So I actually moved from teaching two theme parks and and began on a carousel. And I said to my wife at the time, I said to her, look. I I'm I'm gonna work during the school holidays, and and then that school holiday is extended to six six months. And leave from teaching. And I said, look, if it doesn't I I a role that's permanent and, you know, satisfactory with my skills, then I'll go back to teaching. Well, within six months, I was actually elevated to a park trainer role within Warner Brothers movie world, and and I went from the carousel trainer, and it went from there.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:30 PM
That's that's amazing. It's it's funny because, I mean, if you if you always had to fall back to a trade, you could always Right? Like, that was the sorry. Okay.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:30 PM
I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:30 PM
know that's
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:30 PM
Well, you could teach
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:30 PM
sobbing, I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:30 PM
guess. You know? Yeah. Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:30 PM
On on that note, I will try to get us back on track as much as I can after that. But Sean, you know, you've you've been able to experience a lot of lot of things in your career in the industry, but something that that I remember, and I think has been, like, a beacon within the industry your time at Ferrari World on the opening team. Like, you're able to build a culture from from nothing just from scratch.
Can you walk us through how how can someone do that when there's nothing to start with?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:31 PM
You know, I think that is has been for me the biggest blessing for my success and and my understanding of how culture can be created because we should with a new project, you've got nothing that's taken place before you. There's a blank canvas So on that blank canvas for a new organization that wants to be world class, They only have to imagine where they wanna be and what they wanna be.
And and and once you've imagined that, I you can start to build put the building blocks together to actually get there. And it's so much easier to achieve a culture in that situation where you've got a blank canvas then going to an organization that already has an established culture And it might not be a perfect culture, but you have to undo a lot of it to actually head it in the right direction. And that is really hard work to change the culture that's already been established. But for us at Ferrari World, it was a dream because there was no culture that being established. There was so every single employee that came on we were able to tell the story of the culture that we wanted to create, and we were able to together, imagine and and and set the story and set the tone and and set the policies that helped us to create that culture that we wanted. So in so many ways, we were so lucky to have the ability to imagine it culture and and a world class vision and and build it step by step. It was such an easier process, and we were so lucky. We went to 32 different countries to get employees because we didn't want Prairie World to just be filled with one cultural group We wanted it to be filled with diversity of the world so that everyone, no matter where you world. Everyone else. And yeah. There were so many initiatives that we took, and we strategically made to ensure that we got that vision that we wanted to achieve world class status to achieve world class delivery, and to to have an engaged workforce that just lose so passionate to the back Ferrari and lift experience and and shared it with forgets, and and we achieved that. We were very lucky.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
But it was
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
cheap
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
because we're strategic. Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:34 PM
You know,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
you
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
Go
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:34 PM
ahead. I
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:34 PM
was gonna say, like, it takes a very special person to be able to turn around and say, there was no culture, so that was easy. And then secondarily, we went to 32 countries in the world and brought in people from all over the world and then made a culture out of that and that was that was easier. Like like, I understand what you're saying. Entrenched cultures are hard to deal with, but you had to build a culture from scratch with a very, very unique set of of people.
And and to decide to say, this is who we are. As a set of people. That that's no small cap. And I mean, you're very humble about how you talk about that, but that is a incredible thing to accomplish.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:35 PM
No. I think would really break down what we did there. We all of the leadership team that came on board you know and and this is this is creating culture This is exactly how culture is created when you read about how to create it. It's
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:35 PM
we
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:35 PM
pulled
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:35 PM
it all the leadership into the room. And we said, we imagined what we wanted Right. And we
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:35 PM
we we debated and we we shared so many ideas, and we spent so much time in the in the in the war room as it is, just creating and naming that culture, describing it until we will all on board and we all spoke the same language
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
about what
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
that culture should be. Mhmm. And
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
And then we
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
went about and strategically started to do it within each of our departments, and we kept coming back as a leadership team to say, how are we going and how is our how are we getting each of our individual teams towards that goal. So we were very strategic about that collective being everyone being on board and speaking the same language. And and we were focused. We were so focused on that. And and the induction process is new employees came on board. You know, if first of all, it was, you know, a group of 30, and it was a group of
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
60, and
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:36 PM
then every every week, we had 30 new people join the group. And we we we shared the vision we wanted and we we we had them in our in our palm of our hand because everyone was excited. Excited by it. And because they're excited, they own the vision and they wanted to, you know, to get there as well.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:37 PM
Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. It is I I was reading I'm I'm fascinated by culture. It's one of the things it's like a pet hobby almost now. Just reading culture books and thinking about culture and how can you make it better. And there's no end to it, but as you as you look at it and as you look at what you just said, about, you know, being very deliberate This kind of an old maxim. I certainly didn't come up with it, but which is every business has a culture.
It's what if you set it or if it set itself, it's gonna it's gonna exist. And it it the only way you have a positive culture is to be incredibly deliberate.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:37 PM
And consistent.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:37 PM
Because culture has a tendency of atrophy or of of, you know, degrading over time. If not consistent with it.
So interesting. I I love it. Tim, you wanna move on to the next
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:38 PM
section?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:38 PM
Yeah. Oh, and that's fine. Wait. Wait.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:38 PM
Jordan, I just wanted to say that we named that culture, and and and that culture that we named was we wanted it to be a culture that was out of this world, and we named that culture as we wanted it to be described as a safety culture. We wanted it to be described as a culture of recognition and a culture of of feedback. There was so many aspects to that culture that we wanted people to be able to name. And and see and feel. And so it wasn't just one it was wasn't just one aspect. It was it was quite a large You could describe it in so many ways depending on where you were where you were and what you were feeling at the different times of within
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:39 PM
the
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:39 PM
organization. Mhmm. That's amazing. Like,
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:39 PM
but intentional. Very, very intentional.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:39 PM
Yep.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:39 PM
Yeah. Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:39 PM
Yeah. You touched on
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:39 PM
you touched on all the different countries that you're recruited from, and I'm fortunate come from Morris. Right, where where they also recruit from those countries. And there's there's something really special. When you get so many different viewpoints together and they engage in a way. And I'm you know, I personally don't think that I would be person I am today had I not been exposed to all of that culture over the years.
But yeah. So so it's cool that you could build a culture for the for the new operation with this diverse group of people. And then take it to to such a variety of levels to be able to have it touch every aspect, you know, of the operation and have people people use it in that fashion. But I'm gonna move us on because usually John or I, one of us gets us off in some rabbit hole somewhere. That's true.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:40 PM
Oh. We
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:40 PM
so we touched on this a little bit. So I'll just touch on it a little bit. And I feel like we have a circus theme, and I know, Jerry, I have no idea what you're doing with this. We're gonna talk about the elephant norms. So we have the car. Now we have the elephant.
You know, we're we're trying to develop these cultures within these attractions and tours. And we have service quality and guest experience and all these things that we're that we're moving towards.
But our employees are only there for three or six months in some cases. The year round operations, it's nice because you have that consistency and you can build on it. But when you're starting from near scratch every year, with with a new group of recruits, right, What are fundamental mistakes that that organizations take where they kinda go off the rails, right, and and culture slips.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:40 PM
Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:41 PM
Look. And and
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:41 PM
I think you you you hinted at at the mistake by describing the situation. And the situation being to so many organizations is that they see that their new employees as only be there for six months. Only being there short term. So the the first thing that comes into the organization's mind is well, why best in them in a big way? Why give them the same training the same timing for the induction program when they're only give much or we're not gonna get much back from them. And so that situation creates a whole lot of a lot a whole lot of decisions that can impact negatively what you're trying to achieve, which is a really strong culture that has impact on your business performance and impact on the guest experience.
Look, if an employee is coming for one week, or two years or for long term, it doesn't matter They should all receive the same induction process.
And the same amount of time and the same amount of startup support they need to get on board to understand and to be ambassadors for your organization.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:42 PM
If you
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:42 PM
can't
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:42 PM
you know, out I think the the aim for any induction program for any organization is that people come into are welcomed into your organization and are welcomed in such a way that they understand the organization. They understand where it's going. What it's about, and that they walk out of that induction process motivated and in love with the company. And I say that in love bit. In such a it it means a lot because if your employees are not in love with your company, they can't they don't speak describe our the person that we're in love with. You know? They don't they don't talk to their Right.
So our employees have to feel like they're in love with the company and we have to build that. They have to be proud of their company. So we have
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:43 PM
to build initiatives
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:43 PM
that help them to be proud. Of their company so that they can talk give them things to talk about that make them feel proud. Give them things that they are proud to deliver. To their family and friends, which might be tickets to the park. And they can be proud to share those tickets. All those incentives, all those offers. You know, we've got a be very strategic about making sure that if an employee is here for only six months, that we welcome them just as any other employee. We and we give them the same start up so that they're in love with our company. They can be ambassadors for our company. And they can invest in our company. And by that, I mean, that they when a guest is is you know, shouting at them or angry and and in their face, but they did they are so invested in the company that they defend the company or they they speak positively for the company or that they bend over backwards for the company, to ensure that the guest is treated right. So people don't give that asset unless they're in love with the company.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:45 PM
That reminds me very much of so I read this book. I I pulled off my shelf here while while you were talking, but it reminds me very much of this this book. Hold on. Can I get this on the screen?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:45 PM
Yes.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:45 PM
Disney knew.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:45 PM
Right? And and the story of how Disney went about building a radical culture of engaged, loyal, and they say customer centric employees. And that everyone goes to Disney U and that it is you know they label everything down to, you know, you're you're a staff member. Right? Like, you're not a staff member. You're, like, you're you're part of the show. Right? Like, you you might be backstage, but you're part of the show, and there's, like, this whole this whole kind of idea behind it. And what you said is very much along that same line of getting people radically engaged and ownership of it themselves. And it's just an interesting theme that continues throughout. And I think I certainly see a gap there in most organizations on those kinds of feelings. Right? Like, there's not a lot of effort being put in. And so I guess my question for you to follow on from Tim is to say, you know, when you're talking to ownership of some of these facilities that you work with, they're probably coming and saying, you know, well, show us the ROI. Like, what's the ROI of this? How would you characterize that? Like, how do you approach that for people?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:46 PM
Yeah. And, look, that is a very valid point, Shosa. ROI. And the return on investment for giving hours to staff to do an induction giving hours to staff to do training and and coaching on on service delivery.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:46 PM
It's there.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:46 PM
It's there in the numbers, but the numbers can only they're only useful to you if you're actually measuring for example, when let's just talk about service. Yep.
Mhmm. If we're measuring service before we put implement and initiatives, and then we measure service after the initiative is being implemented. And that that measure might be, you know, a dollar figure on sales, on upsells, or it might be a dollar figure on, you know, overall sales within an outlet or a department. Or it might be retention. And retention is a really good return on investment number to look at when because it costs for people to keep moving on. It costs a lot of money for us to replace people and retrain people. But the longer we keep them, the cheaper it is because we're not reen employing, we're not retraining. But we're also developing highly skilled and highly engaged and and we're developing people that are a lot more effective
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:48 PM
the longer they stay with
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:48 PM
us, the longer they're engaged with us. So that is our huge return on investment in example of why it is so valuable to engage people and put the right amount of time and training into them and to put have all the initiatives to retain our employees. So that they're found in the workplace, they're engaged in the workplace, and they wanna stay in the workplace. So they're really good examples And and look, that that book that you just referenced there would reference would reference the importance of of engagement by design.
Service, by design. Yeah. So when it comes to service, you know, as Tim asked before, you know, that company that doesn't invest a lot of money or a lot of timing to people, full, but Well, they're gonna be the ones that invest just one hour in the new employees in service training. Right?
What impact can one hour of training have on someone to deliver good service? Probably nothing. You know? Yep. But you look at a company that's doing really well in our industry, and they've got they've got service programs that develop skills develop knowledge Yep. And develop commitment from employees. So that I'm an effort that's put into that employee to deliver great service and understand all the systems that help them deliver service is gonna create a better outcome because we're gonna create more money repeat visitors, and we're gonna sell a lot more product and and have a lot more of a better experience for guests. And and that is that is a return on investment for
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
Yeah. That's you
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
know, all that time, training, and coaching. Yeah?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
Yeah. Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
So
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
go ahead.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
And and and
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
that
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
coming back to that, that's by design.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
Yeah. By
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
design,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
we're gonna have better
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
outcomes.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 5:50 PM
So I think we I think everyone would agree The more time you can spend building a culture and nurturing the culture and supporting it, the better it is. But the the business reality of our industry and especially seasonal operators within the industry, is that time is compressed.
Right? So how can you effectively build a culture program knowing that there's limited basically limited resources. Right? There's only so much time that you can pull and set aside to build it, but you wanna do it as effectively as
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
possible.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:50 PM
Okay. And and and that is by design coming up with that you know, you have to road map what their employee journey will look like if they're only here for six months, for example. And so you road map that by actually looking at, you know, the amount of time this spending in induction, and then what does that look like in terms of their on the job training? And then what does that look like in regards to
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:51 PM
being affected
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:51 PM
because we wanna really upscale them really quickly and we wanna have them engaged and ambassadors for our organization really quickly as well. So it's about strategically looking at what does their journey look like, that six month journey, and and how do we overlay what they first of all, what they need to do their job well, and then what do they need to exemplify and be ambassadors for our organization? And you have to sprinkle that over the top. And that might mean that every four weeks or every eight weeks, of their journey, there's some sort of strategic initiative that brings them back to either celebrate or acknowledge, you know, where they've come from, what they've achieved.
And and thank them for that. And and it might be a motivation event. It might be a it might be an opportunity to just gather and do some sort of team event together, a celebration of of what they've achieved so far or you know, we you have to look at their journey how long they're with us, and strategically you know, plan it out. Plan it out. By design.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

SM
Shaun Mckeogh

can happen,

Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:52 PM
budget Disney's gonna have a big budget.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
They've got a bit
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
you know?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
To large budgets,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
so things are gonna
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
look different. I mean, in a small organization, we could still achieve the same outcome.
With a small budget but we do it in different ways. And it's it's how we touch the employees, how we are employees, how we speak to our employees, how we recognize our employees,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
with our words
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
and our presence, it's it's it's that's not money.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:53 PM
Yep.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:53 PM
Were you mean, you often say that organizations succeed when they treat the employees as if they're true stakeholders. And then, of course, from that perspective, the philosophy is that time doesn't really matter. How long they're there if they're there for six weeks or they're there for six years.
And I guess practically, Juan, I think you answered the question. Is is really, like, you're just layering in what they need for the time period that they're there.
And and giving them the sense that they know the job that they're doing, they know what the expectations are and then extend that out into and why it's meaningful
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
to them.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:54 PM
If there's an old sales acheum that says, don't sell them what you wanna sell them. Right? Sell them what they're interested in buying. Right, or what meets their pain, you know, what what they're buying.
So how like, don't know if you're using that question or I feel like we've answered it. This was my question that
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
realized.
Interesting. Yeah. So we
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
I I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
I know what you
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
said.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:54 PM
You you you really touched on the fact that how do we get, you know, our employees to be real partners in the business and to write their part owners. Right? Yeah. And that is really, really any important point that we've had, you know, in in engaging employees in the workplace we have to start aiming towards that. And I'll give you a really good example of of how that impact can be seen. The Warner Brothers movie world many years ago, when I first worked there, I we had employees that would get food and beverage employees and they'd go into their outlet and they would do their job. They'd sell the foods, clean up their outlet, and close the till to cashbox and hand it over. That was the end of their day.
That process would happen every day in every food and beverage outlet.
And the employees really didn't know how much money their outlet made. They didn't know what their individual sales output was.
K? We turn that around a little bit, and as an experiment, and we said to that outlet, okay. You're now in charge of this outlet's profits.
Everything that your team does in this outlet you you'll see all the results.
So by sharing the results with that team, and making them responsible for their profits in their outlet, It was the bakery.
The employees started to notice that, hey. When they made an extraordinary effort and said, with this pie, would you like source They can see that the source the source sales would go up.
The source sale might have been an extra 50¢. Know, with, like, a source of that. And every time they said that, they saw the 50¢ just go up
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:56 PM
and that
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:56 PM
and so the manager of the Atlas said, hey, everyone. Let's all say would you like source with that? Today? And by doing that, this outlet started to learn that wow, if we all said the same thing or we all added something on with the sale. Can hopefully, our
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:57 PM
sales go up
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:57 PM
and that's what they saw. And the that performance of that individual outlet once they had ownership for it increased remarkably.
Because they had ownership and they that could see the results We started to make them business partners.
That's
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:57 PM
fascinating. That's really fascinating.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:57 PM
That. And that made a huge difference.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:57 PM
That's really fascinating because, I mean, tourism interactions is a great example. And it happens in other industries as well, but, of course but but it's pretty full on. Like, you are working very, very long hours. Very long days, for sometimes very brief period of time during the seasonal aspect of it. And you were full on, And it is very easy to kind of devolve into negativity of, oh, why is management making these decisions? Why is this What you just said is a really interesting way of getting people to own something themselves and to take fact that hey. They figured out that they can upsell sauce I bet you that wasn't the only thing they figured out.
So how do you ascertain, like, how do you like, I can't imagine that you come into every facility and it's, like, oh, we have a great culture. It's awesome. Very often, you come in and people are like,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:58 PM
who are you?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 5:58 PM
So how do you address that?
Where do you start? Well,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:58 PM
There are so many
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:58 PM
organizations you go into, and it's just like that. And and look, it's not about it can't be about me and it it's really about it's about the organization coming to the realization of what matters and what makes an impact. And so and sometimes it's as simple as the things that the managers are or are
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
not doing. And you
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
can see it as the consultant or as a, you know, an individual that goes in a being present in the workplace and if they walk through their through their park or their facility, the entertainment center, each day. They can see even the way they walk through their entertainment center by the way that that leader interacts with to get with team members on the way, if they're actually are engaged and if they are respected by their team. By the way in which they're saying hello or they're asking questions or people actually turn their back on them and and and look like they're hard work.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
You can
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
see
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
the
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 5:59 PM
impact that that has. And or doesn't have. And and and that's the starting point. It can't be about me saying, going in and making all the changes. I can't do that. But what I can do is I can I can highlight for businesses those important points that maybe they can't see the things that they're doing or not doing that Yep? Actually make an impact on their team members, and their team members need to feel supported They need to feel part of the team. They need to feel informed. And so even a simple thing like being informed is can be an initiative like well, let's gather our team in the morning before we start work. Let's spend fifteen minutes extra time before we start keeping everyone in the loop.
K? And then hold our leadership responsible by actually say, let's teach our leaders how to conduct that morning session. Effectively. Not just, okay, everyone. This is what's happening today. Let's
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:01 PM
talk about
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:01 PM
a a focus for the day. Let's talk about what we did yesterday really well. Let's talk about what we're expecting today. Let's have a template of the things that could and should or possibly might impact the the impact of that communication session. So we're gonna train our leaders It all the different aspects on how they can be effective.
That's what I can offer is that. Right. I can't do it for them.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:01 PM
No.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:01 PM
Yep. That makes that makes perfect
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:01 PM
sense.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:01 PM
Yeah. No. Sean, you touched on leaders and and really the impact that they can have with
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:01 PM
Go one step up from that because what what I have noticed is organizations that have really great cultures HR has a seat at the table. With the executive team. Right? It's it's not this thing that sits off inside. Like, they're up there. They're involved in the decisions. And it it goes all the way down. So I think that I think that lends to what you're talking Like, you you're building a culture. You just can't build this at the frontline.
Level. Right? It has to go all the way through.
But under that under that, guys, right, what's the biggest misconception that leaders make about culture?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:02 PM
Oh, the biggest misconception I think the biggest misconception is the fact that the culture can't be changed or can't be formed And that they just are happy with the or they just they just don't do anything to impact culture.
Because they feel it's either too hard to change or that it is the way it is. And and I I don't agree with that. I I I I really feel that no matter where a culture of an organization is at any time, that it can be formed it can be impacted, and it can be changed.
With strategic effort of the leadership team and getting on board the rest of the pieces. Organization. It can be impacted and it can be changed.
And in many situations, organizations do need to identify and name what they what call do they have and possibly how it can be shifted. That's really, really important. But to be content with it, and to do nothing or to think that we can't change it, that's just that's just bad leadership. Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:04 PM
Well well, doing nothing is actually doing something. Right? Like, it's the cost of inaction. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right? Yeah. So you've made a conscious decision not to do anything The culture's gonna evolve whether you're leading it or not in some aspect.
Plus Yeah. And leaders will approach it in different ways. Some like,
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:04 PM
I I mean, I've been doing this for a while in my own culture and in other cultures that I worked in over the over my lifespan, where you have this situation where like, we're gonna try and cater to keeping everyone happy. Right? We're gonna we're gonna listen to your employee surveys. We're gonna do and we're gonna try and keep everyone happy. And you realize pretty quickly that there's no way to keep everyone happy You have to keep everyone engaged or at least that's what it feels like. What would you say to that statement?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:05 PM
Yeah. I I I am I'm keeping everyone happy If if that's the attitude of the leaders then I wouldn't like to be there because I don't think it could ever work. We're we're never gonna be able to keep everyone happy. In every organization, no matter what type of culture exists, there's going to be people that are like to take a step back, the people that are not going to possibly fit in that culture? Because they've made a Right. The wrong mistake or they've made the wrong mistake about whether they belong in that organization. And so Yeah. There is a role for organizations to identify who doesn't fit in this culture and move them on. And or to say to four employees, hopefully, to say, hey. Can this is not the culture that I'm gonna feel most I and we want them to step out to identify themselves and to move on. That's what an effective performance probation period is all about. If we Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Sean?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:06 PM
It might it might come back. Give me a second.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:06 PM
Yeah. It's been seeming like there's been Internet issues for the entire time, but I know it's self caching on the local side. So
G
Gerry

Today, 6:06 PM
I was, like, okay with it.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:06 PM
See.
I don't know what
G
Gerry

Today, 6:06 PM
Trolls would have. No.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:06 PM
He's back. Back.
Back. I'm
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:06 PM
back. Oh, you you lost me.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:06 PM
Yeah.
You said something truly profound and we didn't get it. Could you start it all again? Oh,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:06 PM
fantastic. I love it.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:07 PM
Well, let's go back let's go back to the intro. We'll start it there. Now Yeah. Oh, no.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:07 PM
No. No. No. No. No.
G
Gerry

Today, 6:07 PM
Oh, shot.
At around, you know, that's what effective performance probation period is all about.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:07 PM
Yeah. Oh, okay.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:07 PM
Yeah. Did you want me to, lead off on that?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:07 PM
Yeah. That would be great.
Yep.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:07 PM
So in the second performance no. An effective period is is is really about identifying if an employee the employee that we've chosen through the recruitment process is right for our business and is right for our culture. And that probation period, if leaders are not and supervisors are not using that probation period well, and giving feedback and identifying and and coaching and and and and that employee also giving feedback about whether they sit and they've made the right decision to join your organization, If that we're not using that probation period well, then then we're not helping the culture of our organization because potentially, we're letting people into our organization that don't fit our culture and that can negatively impact our culture. So we we that probation period is pretty compressed to move people on or affirm yet. You're the right fit, and and you feel you're the right fit, let's continue to have that relationship.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:08 PM
Yeah. I'm I'm gonna ask you I'm I'm gonna take some rabbit
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:08 PM
hole here.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:08 PM
Because I actually have a a question that I'm really curious about. Sean, how you would approach this.
You have someone who's not a fit in the organization. Right? That you've you've identified them as detrimental to the culture. Right? But they're a high performer. Right? Like, they they service the guests well. They do everything that you need. What do you do?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:09 PM
Okay.
Look. If if it if it was in the if it was in their probation period, then I would utilize that probation period and find possibly check to see that they wanna continue and that and that either we move them on or we and or we develop a plan for them to actually be up what where the culture fit does is not right. We have to be really honest with that. We have to be honest with that and to the the you know, they're impacting negatively on our culture. We have to be upfront with them. We have to sit down, and we have to be open and honest and we have to talk about how what impact they're making. And ultimately, over time, if if you know, through that that two way conversation, if they're not willing come on board with our culture, I think that we should lose them on. And and they should be part of that process knowing that that's the decision where we're heading as well.
Because, ultimately, they're gonna be impacting others around them, and that's not fair. Mhmm. That's not them to actually impact others around them. Look. If they're only performing if they're performing great, and they're doing a great job and they're not impacting others, then I don't think that that matters. They they should be able to stay. If they're impacting others, that's where we have to be upfront and honest. Mhmm. And and work with them and give them a chance, give them a support. But if they're not willing to to change, with that impact, then we gotta move them on.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:11 PM
Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:11 PM
And I would I would suspect happens at most organizations and and most attractions at times.
Like, someone is just isn't in a fit. We've talked a lot about building culture, but this is almost like the
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:11 PM
nurturing part.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:11 PM
Right? Yeah. And and
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:11 PM
look. It's use that example of and you've everyone's heard it before of that bad fruit and you've got a piece of bad fruit in a bowl and it's gonna impact don't take it out, it's gonna impact all the other fruit. Right? Yep. And and we have a responsibility and so many organizations where the culture is bad or we have an ineffective leadership team or HR ineffective HR team or whatever, Mhmm. They're doing that. They're not being open. Honest, and upfront and challenging individuals where improvement is required.
Mhmm. So that scenario for improvement, you know, is is having more impact more stronger leaders that that know that their what their responsibilities are, their roles, and they have the skills and the confidence and confidence to be able to deliver those hard conversations.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:12 PM
So how do you so, you know,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:12 PM
a skill.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:12 PM
We have
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:12 PM
to be able to be now leaders.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:12 PM
I feel like I mean, I feel a little bit like I'm sitting at the feet of of, like, a, like, a a a supreme leader of understanding all this. It's really great. I'm really enjoying this. I'm like, oh, I gotta learn I'm gonna learn so much. It's it's great. And and I know that that's, like, the most insulting thing you can say to a Australian to is to compliment them. So I apologize. I have
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:12 PM
a very
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:12 PM
friend. He always yells at me whenever I give him compliments. So take that as as you will.
But I'll say this. So a lot of attraction especially in the mid market, are families. They're family attractions. Yeah. They've been around for sixty, eighty, ninety years. Like Put on a And Yep. You know, it's it's their brothers and sisters and cousins, and it's all in the family, you know, that kind of thing. And yet you have a marketing person or you have someone who is just wildly toxic, or massively underperforming What on earth do you suggest to leaders in in those organizations to say, here's how you get better?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:13 PM
And that is very much, Sean, a reality that so many attract face is that they are family developed and they're they're filled with many family members and and a long history of of owning and operating their own business and making their own decisions.
A sudden one of the family members might not be performing well. And Yep. But they're family, so no one says anything. And
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:14 PM
Okay.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:14 PM
It's
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:14 PM
it's a very difficult situation. And I but look. It's the if the business is is leadership is shared income, we say in Australia, is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:14 PM
is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:14 PM
is
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:14 PM
is, you know, real about being impactful and getting the best out of their business and their employees then they need to be open and honest and
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:14 PM
to others,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:14 PM
you know, talking about areas for improvement, and people that possibly need need extra training, extra support, or need some coaching in whatever area it is. And I think the fact that
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:15 PM
it's a
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:15 PM
family business, that is an obstacle for everyone else in the business that's not family.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:15 PM
Actually to
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:15 PM
feel that they can't say something, and so they don't say something. But in this situation, in these family businesses, they need to really share and and communicate the importance of of transparency and and empower everyone else in the business to highlight how we can improve and that we need to know. Don't just view us as family. They need to make that point.
Because we actually everyone else in the business that's not family we put that barrier out. We think we can't say something. We shouldn't say something, or else the family's gonna all get together and then, you know, be against us. I think that's that's just a natural thing that happens in our minds. And but you but look. If we do say something about that that manager and if the business does all gang up against us because they're family Yep. Then it's not worth it's not the right business for us to be working in. Because that business is is so family focused that it is detrimental to its success. So we do have to ascertain if that is a reality.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:16 PM
Yep. No. That's I I mean, listen. Great answer. I
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:16 PM
I It's not
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:16 PM
an easy it's not an easy answer, but it's it's something we do have to ascertain. Yeah.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:16 PM
Yeah. Yep. Absolutely.
Tim, what else? I I mean, I almost feel like at this point in time, to a certain extent, I wanted to set you free to start answering questions that we haven't asked, Sean. Like, we'll keep asking questions to keep the conversation moving. But if you suddenly go, I have this thing I wanna drop on you, I Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:17 PM
I mean, I feel like I feel like we're getting so much insight. Like, I'm I'm very much with you, John. Like, Yeah. Like, I've I've heard John speak before, yeah, things, but
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:17 PM
but I feel like we've really gotten to dig into some things. And we haven't made it through, like, half stuff we were gonna ask you. So Yeah. So that's part of it. But, just to kind of riff off, you know, the the family situation, I think that it's not limited to family orgs. Right? You have these larger orgs and lots of times departments become families. Right? And then you could have a a family member right, within that department that
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:17 PM
it is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:17 PM
toxic, and you kinda have to do the same thing with it, but you don't want to because you feel like they're family. You know?
So
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:17 PM
yeah. I just
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:17 PM
wanna make that comparison. There's no question there. That was just a random fleeting thought in my head. So
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:18 PM
This is happening to both of us now.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:18 PM
We're a
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:18 PM
relationship. I see. Go ahead. The relationships we have are are really are really a challenge, actually, within the organization because we all start out most likely within an attraction at the frontline.
And we move up. We become the supervisor and then
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:18 PM
we become
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:18 PM
or team leader and then supervisor and then the manager. And moving from as a team member, we're trying to fit into the team. We're trying to make sure that everyone respects us and is we're we're where we fit in and everyone likes us. And then the moment we become a team member, we do have to start to, you know, sometimes deliver harder, firmer more direct messages, and and so separating ourselves from those friendships and that teamwork and being able to deliver a more firm direct message is really challenging at first.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:19 PM
Mhmm. I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:19 PM
remember when I was made that quick transition from teaching to the theme park industry, Well, I was a teacher, so I was older than everyone else, and I when I first joined on the carousel at Warner Brothers Movie World, you know, I didn't have to fit into the team. I didn't have to worry about the relationships and and being everyone's friend. Mhmm. I was very focused on just doing my job, and showing the skills and and passion I had for the what I wanted to achieve within the industry.
So for me, my my catapult through the industry or or it's becoming a trainer and a manager was quite fast because I already had a lot of those skills. Yep. I didn't have to worry about fitting in with everyone. So that for me was that helped me with my quick transition into the industry. Because I already had lots of skills that were transferable.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:20 PM
Yep.
G
Gerry

Today, 6:20 PM
I wanna jump in here kind of get a question that him or John could reach Sure. Weigh. So I we've had really answers from Sean, We've talked about the problem.
If, like, you know, talked about you had a vision You wanted to become a trainer, and you got there.
For operators who wanted to voucher, you know, like, they have a change it. What are the strategies they can do? Like, how do they problem essentially? We've talked about problems. Now we are talking how do we solve that problem? Question
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:20 PM
that I
G
Gerry

Today, 6:20 PM
can lead us into the next question.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:20 PM
Okay. Yep.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:20 PM
I think that's a great question. Thanks, Jerry.
So with what we've spoken about already, in the various areas of, like, here's the problem definitions, How do you start the process of solving it? Obviously, you have to have a team that's willing to say we have a problem. And we need some we need some help. What's your process? Like, how do you go after solving some of these things?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:21 PM
Look, That is a really interesting question because obviously, every person or every leader or every manager or every supervisor doesn't have all the answers. And and sometimes problems that come to us, it's the first time that we've ever encountered that
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:21 PM
problem. Right. So
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:21 PM
it makes so much sense sorry. It makes so much sense for us to be able to have that opportunity to open the problem or identify what the problem is and open it
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:21 PM
up to
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:22 PM
everyone's opinion So having said that, because that's like a brainstorming session of how we sort everything out. That would logistically make sense. That's how we start sorting our problems. It's identifying all the different routes and and, ways that we could help
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:22 PM
solve it.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:22 PM
And I wanna reference one of the things we did at the park, at Ferrari World in in Abu Dhabi. And what we did there is we implemented because we wanted everyone to be owners in the business, and we wanted everyone to be problem solvers if the business.
So we actually implemented the old suggestion box, which Oh,
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:22 PM
yes.
Its
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:22 PM
just if I say the suggestion box like that for an employee, I everyone just goes, oh, yeah. I know what that is, and that doesn't work. Now it doesn't work if we just have the suggestion box where people put their suggestions in and then those suggestions stay in there for years and never get looked at and never get added. And that's just a token thing. But if I reward, I would have to be one's a process that actually works. To solve problems. So what we did there is we had the session box but we had a training program that we strategically, by design, developed. And that program was about, let's create how to be a business owner. How to be partners in this business. And so we created a process where they all employees could think like the owners of the business.
And they identified for every problem in the business this is what we want you to think about. We want we've templated the process. We want you to think about the outcome, the cost, the timing,
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:23 PM
the resources. You
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:23 PM
know, the the the viability you know, all of those sorts of things that a business owner would think of, to, you know, to solve a problem. And to see if something's workable or not. And then employees then templated and wrote down their their approach to solving problems in the business.
And then when they saw a a health and safety issue, identified the issue, They then said how could be solved, and they thought like a business. Business owner. Then they put that idea into a suggestion box. We then had a process that was by design to actually take that box every month, every week, and actually document all of the suggestions that have been put in all the problems and all suggestions. And then every month, we had representatives from across the the whole organization that would meet and look at every single problem that was in there and suggestion on how to answer it. And then we had a team of people that actually then looked at the viability of the responses that were there, and actually responded to employees. So every employee that put something in got a personal response. We thank you for your suggestion about solving this problem This is what the committee first thought about it, and they put the the responses. Now those responses that were actually implemented and sold the employee actually got twelve months the first twelve months of the value of that problem being solved back in their pay. Uh-huh. So if it was a health and safety issue
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:25 PM
that was
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:25 PM
being solved, and it and our insurance or saved on back issues or whatever it is. Yeah. Then the employee got that money in their in in their pay packet extra for the year. Here's the biz best bit about it.
Is we act actually we had miles and miles of of tunnels under Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi Yeah. Fully tunnels that we could walk under.
And what we did is we used those walls, and we put up the suggestions that we implemented and we put the name of the employee, and then we put how much money they were getting every month for implementing that suggestion. So employees could see how every suggestion was being acknowledged, and responded to, and the impact it was making financially and how that was also coming into their colleagues' pockets. That was Yes. That was problem solving one zero one at Prairie World, and it was oh, we effective.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:26 PM
Yeah. That's a scorecard. Right? Like, that gives people an opportunity to to be a little competitive, but also to be a part of the the equation.
Jerry's suggesting we move on to another section, but I have one other question before I But you have a big focus on safety culture.
And really trying to think about how to have a safe culture for the people involved. That that's I mean, given present political climbs of which are not gonna speak at all, that is a loaded phrase. I'm curious how you define that.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:27 PM
Look, I think a safety culture is very much where If every employee that their responsibility to safety They keep an eye and to take safety seriously.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:27 PM
The the guests that come
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:27 PM
to the the business, but also for their colleagues and themselves. So this that's the three elements to guess, their colleagues, and themselves. And so often, a safety culture can only focus on the guest, Sometimes, it can only focus on, you know, keeping their colleagues safe. It's about keeping them safe as well. And that that threat that three, you know, when it comes to safety is so important. And everyone taking for it and fiddling. It's their responsibility.
Obviously, there needs to be structures to make that happen. And it needs to keep on being reinforced. But ultimately, that's what safety culture is is everyone feeling that this is a safe place because we're in a hard process. Yeah.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:28 PM
Yeah. That makes sense.
Tim, you wanna move this song? Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:28 PM
So sorry. I was well, I was just thinking about one thing, and I I I paused because I hate talking about this time. Right? But during during COVID and post COVID, you urged leader leaders to over communicate.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:29 PM
Right, of what's going on
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
What did that what did that teach us as an industry about cultural resilience within these orgs that basically shut down for a bit?
I'm scared in my way.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:29 PM
You're back.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
Back.
Alright.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
I'm proud of the hair. So
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:29 PM
you say I just I just thought about one thing.
Yep.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
That was about it. That was all I asked. No.
So, you know, during that time that we don't speak
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
of, COVID,
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:29 PM
you urged leaders to over communicate things that were going on. What do you think that taught us as a industry general, especially being that there was a disconnect for a period of time?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:29 PM
Yeah. And there was a huge disconnect for a period of time, but I think in it it COVID taught us that time that we can't speak about that it really organizations that that care a lot and have a lot of a culture that cares for their employees because they kept their employers connected. And they continue to communicate with them and keep them informed and and they might not have had the the finances to keep paying but they still made a commitment to them.
And that was and yeah. For for those companies that didn't have a strong culture, and then COVID hit, I think COVID taught them afterwards about the importance of they certainly learn a lot about the importance of keeping an engaged workforce because it was so much harder for them to restart and and and and pull people back.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:31 PM
Yeah. I I think that kinda rolls into I I think that was a lesson for the for the industry in general. Like, it was a lesson for everyone. You know, in about resilience and the kind of service and lot lots of different aspects. It it completely changed guest experience. Right? Like, technology was adopted at a a huge rate. But but I tend to think about you know, the I I think you call the spirit of an organization. Right? Like, where culture seeps into the guests. Right? I I think that I think that we can tell when something's authentic as humans. Right? And we know when something's manufactured.
Organizations like Disney have done a really good job of that authenticity even though we know it's all store like, it's storytelling, but because the culture is so strong. Mhmm. They've been able to develop that authenticity.
What what recommendations could you give to operators to keep consistency within the culture, keep the authenticity, and you know, are are there any examples from organizations that you've helped or come across? In your travels?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:32 PM
Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:32 PM
Yeah. Look. I I think to keep to to be authentic and to to really deliver an experience that really connects with the guests, I think I think it's really important that our we start with our leadership and our our supervisor levels. And and we give them the skills to be able to impact their team members authentically. And by that, example might be know, speaking with their employees and recognizing their employees and acknowledging the good things that they that they do, That's such an important thing that needs to happen every day because if it's not happening, then our employees just do what they believe that they should be doing. And sometimes that comes across as inauthentic. Whereas and and an example of that is when supervisor says, hey, everyone. Thank you for for your good work today. And all the employees walk out of the green room, and they go, well, we got we got praised. We got thanked. But they don't really know why they got thanked. Right. And so that's a really good example of inner faith ineffective leadership and supervision because they're they're actually trying to be to be nice and and but they're not being effective. But then the supervisors actually say, hey, John. The way in which you recognize that difficult guest at lunchtime with your eye contact and an open demeanour it it really made an impact on the guest. The guest felt as though you really were listening to them. And that you canceled them. You created a repeat visitor in that guest. Thank you for doing that.
And so by teaching our leadership and supervisors that sort of effective feedback and recognition is so much better than that Hey, everyone. Great job
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:34 PM
today.
Because
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:34 PM
what the supervisor and leader is doing is they're actually they're recognizing the small behaviors that we want to be repeated with our guests. And those behaviors Right. The things that help the guest experience. And so it's all about the leaders and the supervisors and their skilling them and empowering them with the right the right effective things to do with their team so that our team are really impacting the guest experience. And it's about recognizing the small behaviors we want repeated each
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:35 PM
time. Yeah. Reminds me of of the Dale Carnegie, to make friends and influence people. Like, that idea of, you know, that don't ever give someone a compliment that's like, good job. You always be, like, very specific about what you're complimenting them about. For that same reason. And that idea of smile and say their name is the most important word in their life and, you know, those kinds of things. I I I I think it's fascinating to see how Yeah. Those things have been kinda universal truths that carry forward and are are so useful And are probably not enforced or at least underlined enough to really we need to be reminded on a regular basis. I appreciate that.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:36 PM
Yeah. And and we we say so often, we hear how you know, make the workplace fun and there is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:36 PM
a truth
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:36 PM
to that. And it's not that we have to be doing fun things, but it's about just, you know, when we come together for that morning briefing, you know, being open with each other as a team and being really present That's what makes it fun or being strategic about you know, doing a team building activity in that morning briefing, and then setting what everyone up in the team to actually go out with a happy attitude back to the guests for the day. That's about making the workplace smarter. It's about being you know, working with our human resource department to actually have a by design engagement program where we're inviting people back to celebrations that are fun and engaging. We can celebrate as a team and our achievements and and by design, that's making the workplace fun.
It's it's been creative in the workplace, and at the right time, just being authentic. You know?
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:37 PM
Yeah. Totally. It's you know, it's I'll say it this way. You are a both a very engaging and fun individual to interview and also a very hard interview, and I'll tell you why. I'm watching Tim and I'm watching myself on the camera occasionally, and I'm seeing us pause, look up to the right as we're approached us what you're
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:37 PM
saying. Oh,
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:37 PM
I need to think about that a little bit. And so it's it's I'm having this great opportunity to learn at the same time as kinda think about, well, how would I apply that? In my own like, inside of Rosales or inside of, like, how we work with our own teams. And it it's it's just fascinating to listen to We're gonna transition to what we call the lightning round, which is a terrible misnaming of what it actually is. And what I'm gonna tell you just to take away any of the pressure and stress is, Tim and I ruin the lightning round every single time by talking too much. Because the purpose of the lightning round is simply to ask questions and get a quick answer. But it's never it's never our visitor that is the problem. It is always us. So we're gonna kick off the lightning round, and then you're gonna watch the spectacular failure failure. Although, we're gonna be optimistic that this time is the time we're gonna get it right. So it's a theme we have going so
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:38 PM
It's the only thing we do consistently. Yeah. Okay. Here
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:38 PM
we go.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:38 PM
Best attraction you've ever visited purely for
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:39 PM
fun.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:39 PM
Universal Studios in Japan.
Wow. The parade is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:39 PM
so it engaging. The best. Cool.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:39 PM
That's cool. I haven't checked that one out yet. I'm looking forward to
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:39 PM
it.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:39 PM
Higher for attitude or skills?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:39 PM
Attitude, definitely. Because we can teach skills, we can teach basics, we can coach, but we can't teach o two.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:39 PM
Most overrated training exercise.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:39 PM
Most override training exercise is the marketing department saying, bring everyone back into the training room for an hour and give them some guest service
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:40 PM
Take them out of take them out of the place with guests and bring them somewhere there's none.
Yeah. I was I I've never did that. I was a marketer. I never did that. I'm proud to say that. Biggest hiring biggest hiring mistake you see.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:40 PM
Employing people at the front line that don't naturally smile in the interview.
Or and my other big faux pas, you know, in in the recruitment process is having people at the frontline that we're they're implying for recruiting for, And just looking at their CV, this CV has got nothing to do with, you know, their presence and
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:40 PM
and, you know,
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:40 PM
how well they're gonna do in the workplace.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:40 PM
Cross training seasonal staff. Essential or nice to
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
have?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:41 PM
Seasonal start.
It's a nice to have. I think it's a nice to have because then they're aware of how other departments work and and they're aware of other other products, and they're gonna be so much better ambassador if they are cross trained. But not essential.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
Not essential.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
Best way to keep seasonal workers returning year after year?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
Just some
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
Money? To the employees and make and
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:41 PM
engage the workplace.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:41 PM
Look, I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:41 PM
I I think money is we have to be real, and money is important. Right? It's gotta be fair.
Okay? And so long as we're being fair with the money, that is a given. Right? We shouldn't but it shouldn't be the only reason. The extra icing on the cake is gonna be whether they've had a good talk and whether they you know, are proud of the workplace and and enjoy the work That's really, really important. Yeah. They have to be engaged in the workplace.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:42 PM
Mhmm.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:42 PM
Most underutilized tool for building culture.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:42 PM
I would say the employee engagement survey or spot surveys either or, is underutilized in the it's only done and the results are looked at.
But in an effective organization, they do it then they analyze it, then they hold every department responsible for saying what initiatives they're going to implement to impact the results on the next one. And holding them accountable to that process.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:43 PM
Constant improvement. But many constant improvement? Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:43 PM
Well, I I think that they've see, here I go. I'm running at You know? I think of the importance of having having cultural KPIs in your business KPIs. For the year. Right? I don't think that we too many organizations think about that at at that level.
But best way to recognize employees.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:43 PM
By being very strategic and personal, I think, with our words and and by using their name, and being very specific and and just making it really personal and you know, the fact that I appreciated what they've done and saying that that and looking at them in the eye, that's so important.
Mhmm.
One lead And I I say that with a tone low because it's about being personal.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:44 PM
Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:44 PM
I I think I
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:44 PM
made that
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:44 PM
dip that point.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:44 PM
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
One leadership quality every future leader should have.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:44 PM
Oh, gee, that's a really, really tough one.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:44 PM
I want I want them to
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:44 PM
have so many
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:44 PM
I know.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:44 PM
But gee. I I think
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:44 PM
I think that the ability to recognize well and that's not just to recognize what people are doing well but recognizing what they're not doing well and recognize the gaps in their performance and being able to have the confidence and the capability to actually communicate that and it in their recognition with the employee because that is that's plus gonna help that process of continual improvement and helping the employee to do better and feel better about what they do, the contribution they make to the business.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
Mhmm.
Yep. Amazing. We didn't
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
do too bad. We didn't do too bad on Lightning. This this is the best
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:45 PM
we've done. Yeah. It's true. Well,
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
I think
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
I think we need to name it something other than lightning. Because I don't think that was Lightning. Firm
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:45 PM
one way or the other, but I think that's the best he does. Yeah.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
So so we got a couple more questions for you, and then we'll let you go.
Right? You know, you've
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
built what?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
Did John say
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:45 PM
yes? No.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:46 PM
So you you built a
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:46 PM
career on
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:46 PM
helping people deliver, you know, these magical experiences, and there are a lot of operators I hope I hope there's a lot of operators listening right now. But for those operators, that's better. For those operators who are listening right now who are either thinking about culture and things that they can change now and year round, operations or those in seasonal operations that are thinking about how can we implement change next year. What's the one thing that they should start doing next week? Or or tomorrow. To effect change.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:46 PM
Yeah.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:46 PM
Look. I I think that one thing that they could do to next week is
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:46 PM
is just
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:46 PM
gather people in the room their leadership team, or including representatives from, you know, all different levels of the organization, and just ask the question about how we're doing when it
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:47 PM
comes to
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:47 PM
service and and and and the guest experience. And just to have that open workshop you know, few hours or a whole day where just different organization are just being really open and honest and just capturing that snapshot and then asking the question, how can we do better? Because then then starts the process of being able to focus on something as a whole organization no matter what part of the business we're in. We can be focused on that. And it gives us something collectively that we focus on we'll start to create common language, identifying the common issues, and then starting to problem solve that process. And and hopefully, in the end, what we've done is we've by going through facing something a challenge like that, and that's collective across the whole organization, we're we're we're developing the culture of the station because we're we're we're stuck serviceism. Good or we're we're starting to talk about human resources issues. We're starting to talk about leadership issues. It opens up a whole can of worms if you like in regards to change management and what needs to change. And and that process in itself is a good process. A healthy process. We can start it next week. And, everyone has a view on it. Mhmm. Everyone can be engaged in that process. And then we can start building a plan. And towards continual improvement. And and Tim, I think you've heard me say this before, but I you know, if an organization does not have a detailed plan written down about how they're going to deliver service and achieve service, then service service delivery is not important to them. And so many organizations don't have a detailed plan written down. They just just say we we aim for it.
And and that's something they can start next week and believe me, it will engage everyone at every level.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:49 PM
Mhmm. Mhmm.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:49 PM
I mean, that leads into the the follow on question that I would I would I'll ask is know, what qualities do you see in the next gen leaders the next gen attraction leaders what are they gonna need most?
You know, in managing their teams? And and how do you cultivate that And you've answered a little bit of it, but the how are you looking at the next gen leaders, like, the the leaders of ten years from now? How do we cultivate those? Like, how do we cultivate those people?
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:49 PM
Yeah. And I I think that, what is something that's been evolving is that we can't presume that our next gen leaders have the skills that we presume that they have
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:50 PM
Right. Mhmm.
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:50 PM
As an organization. What we do need to do is we need to identify be in our leaders at our organization, and every organization's different. So go through that process of of identifying the skills for our organization, for our leaders, and identifying you know, what is profiling what is a good leader at our organization and being able to name that and that helps us in that strategic planning process. And I certainly think that communicate and managing up is important, and managing down and managing you know, across our colleagues and and and and having being brand ambassadors and what that means to be a good brand and it is very important. And looking at what it means to be a brand ambassador for our organization, and and looking at having the hard conversations with our employees and being real and being effective when it comes to recognition and being effective when it comes to feedback and being effective when it comes to strategically planning and and there's so there's I don't think anything's changed from the past, but I think what is important is that every organization needs to identify what are the skills for each leaders at its place.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:51 PM
Mhmm. Yeah.
JP
John Pendergrast

Today, 6:51 PM
That makes sense. That makes sense.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:51 PM
Yeah. I I I think you just answered my question. So my last question. I'm gonna phrase it a little bit differently. Right?
Give you the opportunity to leave a final thought for leaders in our industry about culture? What would that be?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:52 PM
Gee.
I think
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:52 PM
It's just final for this podcast. It's not your final thought. Just so we're clear. Right?
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:52 PM
I think
SM
Shaun Mckeogh

Today, 6:52 PM
culture makes a difference. So so so take a moment to be strategic about culture. And and and know that by design, you can impact culture. By design. That's what we have to do.
TS
Tim Samson

Today, 6:52 PM
That's us.
You know, I I really appreciate what you do for the industry.
And and how you've helped organizations grow their culture. Really enjoyed the time. That we spent today, and I I hope that everyone listening also did. So for coming on, climbing around with us a little bit. I had to throw that out there. I don't know why, but But but thank you once again for joining

long run.
