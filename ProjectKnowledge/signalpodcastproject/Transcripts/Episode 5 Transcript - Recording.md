Shaun McKeogh (00:00.806)
I'm in for that.

John Pendergrast (00:01.134)
And, you get to roll the dice here, because I did the last one. So you get to read the... Let's see. Okay. So we're going do an intro. After saying hi, so we do an intro. Now, here's the best part about the intro is that the last intro, we're having kind of competitions between each other of who can do it perfectly.

And the last intro I did earlier today actually and I nailed it. And so the pressure's on now for Tim to see if he can accomplish the same goal.

Tim Samson (00:21.618)
It's not gonna be me.

Tim Samson (00:33.595)
I will, spoiler, it's not going to happen, right? I'll just tell you that. We'll just do that to start. Who has the first question after the intro? Is it John or me? Okay, so nice. And then Sean, pronounce the last name, McKeough? Close? Not close. McKeough?

John Pendergrast (00:46.797)
Nice.

Shaun McKeogh (00:56.273)
Yeah, Makio. Yeah. Yeah, that's absolutely, perfectly, Makio, yeah.

Tim Samson (01:03.481)
Okay. And then the pronunciation of King Power, Mahanakorn?

Shaun McKeogh (01:13.265)
Mahanakorn, yeah. Mahanakorn, yeah.

Tim Samson (01:17.757)
All right, see I got I have tough words John

John Pendergrast (01:23.508)
Listen, mean if you need an excuse, that's fine. You go ahead and use it.

Tim Samson (01:25.981)
I need all the excuses. I need all of them

John Pendergrast (01:32.974)
you

Tim Samson (01:36.551)
This is not going to go well. I feel it already.

John Pendergrast (01:39.03)
I believe in you. I believe in you.

Shaun McKeogh (01:45.862)
you

Tim Samson (01:47.037)
I wish I had that energy. Are you recording? Are we recording? so I can just go? I was waiting for you to tell me to go.

John Pendergrast (01:50.168)
Hoorah, let's go. Yeah, we've been recording the whole time. Yeah.

Go.

Shaun McKeogh (02:07.261)
Come on team, you can do it. You can do it.

Tim Samson (02:07.74)
This is not gonna work.

John Pendergrast (02:09.07)
We're gonna see, this is all gonna seem so professional, Sean, and behind the scenes you're gonna be like, these guys are craps, something's wrong with these guys. But when it comes out, you're be like, wow.

Tim Samson (02:18.201)
No, he has known that he has known that about me he's just gonna think about you now, so yeah

John Pendergrast (02:23.788)
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Well, I hired you. It says a lot right there.

Shaun McKeogh (02:23.805)
You

Tim Samson (02:28.666)
Alright, we're ready? I'm ready. I'm not ready. I can't watch you guys. I'm covering the camera. Okay.

John Pendergrast (02:30.2)
Yes.

John Pendergrast (02:36.334)
You

Tim Samson (02:42.246)
Okay, here we go, got it. This is gonna be how it takes, I can feel it already.

It's time to crank up our cultural IQ because today we're joined by none other than Sean McKeough, a guy whose name is basically a cheat code for how to fix guest experience, culture, and leadership when your staff flips faster than a roller coaster. If you've ever been to Iapa in the last decade, chances are you witnessed Sean in his natural habitat, leading workshops, mentoring rising stars, and crafting training systems that actually stick, even in the chaos of our industry.

Sean's story started in the front lines of Australia's mega parks, but let's be real, he didn't stop there. He's been at the launch pad for Ferrari World. Abudabbi? See, I messed up already. Abudabbi!

Shaun McKeogh (03:30.621)
That's it.

Tim Samson (03:36.729)
I can redo this at the end, but in steered operations at King Power Mahanakorn in Bangkok, here's what set Sean apart. Sean apart. Well, most folks cross their fingers and hope culture just happens. Sean's out there with blueprints and scaffolding, literally architecting the stuff everyone else dreams about. These days he's the ringleader at Attractions Academy, tackling the giant essential question our industry loves to ignore. How do you build a culture that lasts when half of your team is gone every six months?

Sean's magic trick isn't about tech, rides, or trendy acronyms. It's about systems that make frontline staff deliver real, memorable guest experiences year after year, no matter how wild the staff turnover gets. Sean, welcome to Cigna.

Shaun McKeogh (04:23.293)
Thank you so much. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, John.

John Pendergrast (04:28.556)
Yeah, we're super excited to have you here. And Tim, you did a great job. Mine is to Abu Dhabi. And to be fair, Abu Dhabi is one of those things that sounds like you're saying it wrong when you're saying it right. So, that's good.

Shaun McKeogh (04:31.737)
I'm excited too!

Tim Samson (04:41.059)
Right. But if I re-record that and Jerry likes places that no one will know and they'll have no reference for what you just said.

Shaun McKeogh (04:47.965)
I like it, I like it. Just leave it the way it is.

John Pendergrast (04:48.952)
So I like it. Yeah. So we were doing this recording earlier and I was, I started this way to say, don't worry about what you say here because the reality is, that we have an grade a expert editor. And at the beginning of our first podcast in episode one, I was watching it through. I'm like, this is great. mean, Tim, she's cutting him perfectly.

Tim Samson (04:50.992)
Hahaha!

John Pendergrast (05:12.878)
We're gonna get to me, I'm gonna have no cuts, it's gonna be great. And then it was like every word was a new cut. I'm not even sure I said what she has me saying because it was so many cuts. But anyways, we seem really professional. So everything you say here, we probably won't cut you at all, but us, we'll cut lots. we'll go from there. So how we like to start these things is to break them into kind of sections. And so to have a little bit of method to the madness.

We started off with what we call part one and listen, from clown to consultant origins, there's obviously a history there. And so instead of asking, well, no, maybe I will ask this question. Sean, you've worn many hats in the industry, even literally as a clown early in your career. How did you get here and end up in training?

Shaun McKeogh (06:07.469)
God, I don't know where you got this background information, but yeah, I was a clown in my career.

Shaun McKeogh (06:17.437)
Where did you get this information? my God. I actually, many, many years ago, I was in the Moomba Clown Club. And Moomba is a Melbourne festival in Australia. And it's been going on for many, many years. And they had a professional clown club. And I joined it because I wanted to be a clown. And I developed my own costume, my own name for my clown and my own look.

John Pendergrast (06:17.551)
you

Tim Samson (06:20.475)
F-

John Pendergrast (06:21.774)
We have really good sourcing.

Shaun McKeogh (06:45.125)
And I spent 12 months in training in these classes going every weekend to the Moonba Clown Club. it, suppose the big thing that we aimed for was the parade that we had every year through the city. And I actually did the parade in my own costume as a clown. I have no idea how you got that info.

John Pendergrast (07:07.64)
We have our sources, and we have our sources. Yeah.

Shaun McKeogh (07:11.857)
So what was your question?

John Pendergrast (07:13.582)
Yeah, see that was a really great, it was a great political answer there because we asked a question and then he reframed it and now I don't even know. I'm gonna go back and read it. You've worn a lot of hats, including being a clown as you know as a team. How on earth did you end up as a trainer?

Tim Samson (07:17.909)
You

Tim Samson (07:27.673)
You

Shaun McKeogh (07:36.446)
Good question. Good question. Well, I suppose I'd be... No, I couldn't get the juggling. I was very good at smiling as a clown, so that got me through the parade. But yeah, I began my career as a teacher, a primary school teacher. And I was a good primary school teacher or elementary teacher, as you say in the USA. And I did that for about 10 years. But...

Tim Samson (07:39.354)
He wasn't very good at juggling. No.

John Pendergrast (07:50.67)
He wasn't the sad clown.

Shaun McKeogh (08:05.647)
I really didn't want to stay in teaching. For me, there wasn't enough diversity. And so I'd always had my heart set on working in the creative industry, really in the film industry where I could, I don't know, create a story or be part of that creative process. And so theme parks for me, it kind of just fell into place that

Theme parks was a place where I actually could actually have a contribution that was related to people and related to the environment and getting people ready to deliver a great experience and tell a great story. So I actually moved from teaching to theme parks and began on a carousel. And I said to my wife at the time, said to her, look, I'm...

gonna work during the school holidays and then that school holidays extended to six months and leave from teaching. And I said, look, if it doesn't work after six months and I don't get a role that's permanent and satisfactory with my skills, then I'll go back to teaching. Well, within six months, I was actually elevated to a park trainer role within Warner Brothers Movie World.

And so I went from the carousel to trainer and it went from there.

Tim Samson (09:36.983)
Bye.

John Pendergrast (09:40.623)
That's amazing. It's funny because I mean, if you always had to fall back to a trade, you could always fall back to clowning, right? that was the... Sorry. I know that's why I lied.

Tim Samson (09:50.488)
You

Shaun McKeogh (09:51.836)
I thought you were going to say teaching. But teaching has served me very well.

Tim Samson (09:53.964)
Well, you could teach clouding, guess, you know. On that note, I will try to get us back on track as much as I can after that. But Sean, you you've been able to experience a lot of things in your career in the industry, but something that I remember and I think has been like a beacon within the industry is your time at Ferrari World on the opening team.

Like you're able to build a culture from nothing just from scratch. Can you walk us through how can someone do that when there's nothing to start

Shaun McKeogh (10:33.831)
You know, I think that has been for me the biggest blessing for my success and my understanding of how culture can be created because with a new project, you've got nothing that's taken place before you. There's a blank canvas. So on that blank canvas for a new organization that wants to be world class, they only have to imagine.

where they wanna be and what they wanna be. And once they've imagined that, you can start to put the building blocks together to actually get there. And it's so much easier to achieve a culture in that situation where you've got a blank canvas than going to an organization that already has an established culture. And it might not be a perfect culture.

But you have to undo a lot of it to actually head it in the right direction. And that is really hard work to change the culture that's already been established. But for us at Ferrari World, it was a dream because there was no culture that had been established. So every single employee that came on, we were able to tell the story of the culture that we wanted to create.

Tim Samson (11:36.759)
Thank

Tim Samson (11:50.519)
Pretty cool.

Shaun McKeogh (12:01.263)
And we were able to together imagine and set the story and set the tone and set the policies that helped us to create that culture that we wanted. So in so many ways, we were so lucky to have the ability to imagine it, a culture and a world-class vision and build it step by step. was such an easier

Tim Samson (12:26.711)
Okay.

Shaun McKeogh (12:31.101)
process. And we were so lucky, we went to 32 different countries to get employees, because we didn't want Friarie World to just be filled with one cultural group, we wanted it to be filled with the diversity of the world, so that everyone, no matter where you came from in the world, you were welcomed. And we wanted our staff to represent everyone else. And yeah, there were so many initiatives that we took.

And we strategically made to ensure that we got that vision that we wanted to achieve world-class status, to achieve world-class delivery, and to have an engaged workforce that just was so passionate about Ferrari and lived the experience and shared it with the guests. And we achieved that. And we're very lucky. But it was achieved because we were strategic. Yeah.

Tim Samson (13:29.441)
You know, you've got.

John Pendergrast (13:29.443)
You know, go ahead. I was gonna say like, it takes a very special person to be able to turn around and say, there was no culture, so that was easy. And then secondarily, we went to 32 countries in the world and brought in people from all over the world and then made a culture out of that. And that was easier. Like, I understand what you're saying. Entrenched cultures are hard to deal with, but.

you had to build a culture from scratch with a very, very unique set of people and to decide to say, is who we are as a set of people, that's no small tap. And I mean, you're very humble about how you talk about that, but that is a incredible thing to accomplish.

Shaun McKeogh (14:18.808)
Look, I think if we really break down what we did there, we all of the leadership team that came on board, you know, and this is is creating culture, you know, this is exactly how culture is created. When you read about how to create it is we pulled all the leadership into the room. And we said, we imagined what we wanted. And we

We debated and we shared so many ideas and we spent so much time in the war room as it is, just creating and naming that culture and describing it until we were all on board and we all spoke the same language about what that culture should be. And then we went about and strategically.

John Pendergrast (15:00.835)
Mm-hmm.

Shaun McKeogh (15:14.776)
started to do it within each of our departments. And we kept coming back as a leadership team to say, how are we going? And how are we getting each of our individual teams towards that goal? So we were very strategic about that collective, everyone being on board and everyone speaking the same language. And...

Tim Samson (15:32.949)
Okay.

Shaun McKeogh (15:42.075)
We were focused, we so focused on that. And the induction process as new employees came on board, first of all, was a group of 30 and then it was a group of 60. And then every week we had 30 new people join the group and we shared the vision we wanted and we had them in our palm of their hand because everyone was excited by it.

And because they're excited, they own the vision and they wanted to, you know, to get there as well.

Tim Samson (16:20.116)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (16:21.539)
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. It is, I was reading, I'm fascinated by culture. It's one of the things that's like a pet hobby almost now, like reading culture books and thinking about culture and how can you make it better. And there's no end to it. But as you look at it and as you look at what you just said about being very deliberate, there's kind of an old maxim. I certainly didn't come up with it, but which is every business has a culture. It's...

Tim Samson (16:32.756)
.

John Pendergrast (16:49.871)
what if you set it or if it set itself, it's gonna exist. the only way you have a positive culture is to be incredibly deliberate and consistent. Because culture has a tendency of atrophy or of degrading over time if you're not consistent with it. So interesting, I love it. Tim, you wanna move on to the next section? Oh, and let's go to the next one.

Tim Samson (16:52.148)
you

Shaun McKeogh (17:12.454)
Yeah. And look, John, I just wanted to say that we named that culture and that culture that we named was we wanted it to be a culture that was out of this world. And we named that culture as we wanted it to be described as a safety culture and wanted it to be described as a culture of recognition and a culture of...

Tim Samson (17:14.036)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (17:37.551)
Yeah, I hear it.

Tim Samson (17:39.636)
Thank

Shaun McKeogh (17:41.795)
feedback. There were so many aspects to that culture that we wanted people to be able to name and see and feel. so it wasn't just one, it wasn't just one aspect. was quite a lot. You could describe it in so many ways, depending on where you were and what you were feeling at the different times within the organization.

Tim Samson (18:09.511)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (18:10.243)
That's amazing. But intentional. Very, very intentional. Yeah.

Shaun McKeogh (18:14.394)
Yep. Yeah.

Tim Samson (18:16.507)
Yeah, you touched on you touched on all the different countries that you recruited from and I am fortunate to come from Maurice, right? Where where they also recruit from those countries and there's there's something really special when you get so many different viewpoints together and they engage in a way and I, you know, I personally don't think that I would be the person I am today had I not been exposed to all of that culture over the years.

But yeah, so it's cool that you could build a culture for the new operation with this diverse group of people and then take it to such a variety of levels to be able to have it touch every aspect of the operation and have people use it in that fashion. But I'm gonna move us on because usually John or I, one of us gets us off in some rabbit hole somewhere. So.

John Pendergrast (19:09.485)
Yeah, it's true.

Tim Samson (19:11.86)
Um, so we touched on this a little bit, so I'll just touch on it a little bit. And I feel like we have a circus theme and I know Jerry, I have no idea what you're doing with this, but we're going to talk about the elephant in the room. So we have the car and now we have the elephant. Um, you know, we're, we're trying to develop these cultures within these attractions and tours. Uh, and we have service quality and guest experience and all these things that were, that we're moving towards. Um, but our employees are only there for three or six months in some cases.

The year round operations, it's nice because you have that consistent scene you can build on it. But when you're starting from near scratch every year with, with a new group of recruits, right? What are fundamental mistakes that, that organizations take where they kind of go off the rails, right? And culture slips.

Shaun McKeogh (20:02.641)
Yeah. Look, and I think you hinted at the mistake by describing the situation. And the situation being for so many organizations is that they see their new employees as only being there for six months, only being there short term. So the first thing that comes into the organization's mind is, well,

Why invest in them in a big way? Why give them the same training? Why give them the same timing for the induction program when they're only gonna be here for six months and they're not really gonna give much or we're not gonna get much back from them? So that situation creates a whole lot of decisions that can impact negatively

Tim Samson (20:36.668)
Hmm.

Shaun McKeogh (21:00.997)
what you're trying to achieve, which is a really strong culture that has impact on your business performance and impact on the guest experience. Look, if an employee's coming for one week or two years or for long term, it doesn't matter. They should all receive the same induction process and the same amount of time and the same amount of startups

that they need to get on board to understand and to be ambassadors for your organization. If you can't, you know, I think the aim for any induction program, for any organization is that people come into, are welcomed into the organization and are welcomed in such a way that they understand the organization. They understand where it's going, what it's about.

Tim Samson (21:39.314)
Thank

Shaun McKeogh (21:59.42)
and that they walk out of that.

Tim Samson (22:39.441)
Thanks for watching.

Tim Samson (22:56.465)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (23:24.114)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (23:44.817)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (24:07.439)
reminds me very much of, so I read this book, I pulled off my shelf here while you were talking, but it reminds me very much of this book. Oh, hold on, can I get this on the screen? Disney New, right? And the story of how Disney went about building a radical culture of...

Tim Samson (24:08.145)
Sorry.

Tim Samson (24:18.353)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (24:29.679)
engaged, loyal, they say customer centric employees. And that everyone goes through Disney U and that it is, you know, they label everything down to, you know, you're a staff member, right? Like you're not a staff member, you're like, you're part of the show, right? Like you might be backstage, but you're part of the show. And there's like this whole, this whole kind of idea behind it. And what you said is very much along that same line of getting people radically engaged and ownership

Tim Samson (24:59.368)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (24:59.633)
of it themselves and

It's just an interesting theme that continues throughout. I think I certainly see a gap there in most organizations on those kinds of feelings, right? Like there's not a lot of effort being put in. And so I guess my question for you to follow on from Tim is to say, you know, when you're talking to ownership of some of these facilities that you work with, they're probably coming and saying, you know, well, show us the ROI. Like, what's the ROI of this? How would you characterize that? Like, how do you approach that for people?

Tim Samson (25:21.2)
Thank

Tim Samson (25:24.72)
you

Tim Samson (25:36.112)
.

Tim Samson (25:47.504)
Thank

Tim Samson (26:33.455)
Yeah.

Thank you.

Tim Samson (26:50.696)
Okay.

Thank

Tim Samson (27:17.903)
Hi.

John Pendergrast (27:52.536)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (27:55.887)
Thank you. I'm a moment to thank here. I'm going to a to you for being I'm a you for being here. I'm going to to you for for I'm going to for

Tim Samson (28:24.238)
Great.

Tim Samson (28:50.287)
Okay.

Thank you.

Okay.

So.

John Pendergrast (29:09.551)
Yeah, that's a return on investment for sure.

Yeah. Go ahead, Tim.

John Pendergrast (29:20.056)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (29:25.454)
So I think everyone would agree, the more time you can spend building a culture and nurturing the culture and supporting it, the better it is. But the business reality of our industry, and especially seasonal operators within the industry, is that time is compressed. So how can you effectively build a culture program knowing that there's basically limited resources?

Right, there's only so much time that you can pull and set aside to build it, but you want to do it as effectively as possible.

Tim Samson (30:56.609)
Okay.

Tim Samson (31:11.533)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (31:34.253)
Thank

Tim Samson (31:53.311)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (31:57.902)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (32:35.567)
Well, you often say that organizations succeed when they treat the employees as if they're true stakeholders. And then, of course, from that perspective, the philosophy is that time doesn't really matter. How long are they there? If they're there for six weeks or they're there for six years. And I guess practically, and I think you answered the question, is really like you're just layering in what they need for the time period that they're there.

and giving them the sense that they know the job that they're doing, they know what the expectations are, and then extend that out into and why it's meaningful to them. There's an old sales axiom that says, don't sell them what you want to sell them, right? Sell them what they're interested in buying, right? Or what meets their pain, you know, what they're buying.

So how, like, I don't know if there is even a question here, I feel like we've answered it. This was my question and I realized we didn't answer it. Maybe we just move on. Interesting.

Tim Samson (33:33.045)
Yep, so we.

John Pendergrast (33:51.864)
Yeah.

Yeah.

Tim Samson (34:49.669)
Bye!

John Pendergrast (35:07.47)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (35:28.267)
I'm not going to go into steps that I've I'm going into the steps that that I've going the I'm I'm to the steps I'm steps to I'm going I'm going go the I'm going the I'm

Tim Samson (35:57.13)
Yes.

Tim Samson (36:34.314)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (36:39.657)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (36:40.558)
That's really fascinating.

That's really fascinating because I mean, tourism attractions is great example. And it happens in other industries as well, but of course, but it's pretty full on. Like you are working very, very long hours, very long days for sometimes very brief period of time during the seasonal aspect of it. And you were full on.

Tim Samson (36:49.802)
Thank

John Pendergrast (37:03.334)
And it is very easy to kind of devolve into negativity of, why is management making these decisions? Why is this? What you just said is a really interesting way of getting people to own something themselves and to take personal pride in the fact that, hey, they figured out that they can upsell sauce. And I bet you that wasn't the only thing they figured out.

Tim Samson (37:21.608)
You miss it.

John Pendergrast (37:24.138)
So how do you ascertain, how do you, like I can't imagine that you come into every facility and it's like, we have a great culture. It's awesome. Very often you come in and people are like, who are you? So how do you address that? Where do you start?

Tim Samson (37:42.506)
Peace.

Tim Samson (37:47.658)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (37:53.517)
Right.

Tim Samson (38:03.316)
Thanks.

Thank

Tim Samson (38:35.753)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (40:09.256)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (40:22.152)
you

John Pendergrast (40:40.611)
Yep, that makes perfect sense.

Tim Samson (40:43.112)
Yeah, no, Sean, you touched on leaders and really the impact that they can have within a culture. I want to go one step up from that because what I have noticed is organizations that have really great cultures. HR has a seat at the table with the executive team, right? It's it's not this thing that sits off its side like they're up there. They're involved in the decisions.

And it goes all the way down. I think that.

I think that lends to what you're talking about. Like you're building a culture. You just can't build it at the frontline level, right? It has to go all the way through. But under that, under that guise, right? What's the biggest misconception that leaders make about culture?

Tim Samson (43:10.298)
Yeah, well well doing nothing is actually doing something right like it's the cost of inaction on the culture Right. So you've made a conscious decision not to do anything The culture is gonna evolve Whether you're leading it or not in some aspect

John Pendergrast (43:28.553)
Well, and leaders will approach it in different ways. like, I mean, I've been doing this for a while in my own culture and in other cultures that I've worked in over my lifespan, where you have this situation where it's like, we're gonna try and cater to keeping everyone happy, right? We're gonna listen to employee surveys, and we're gonna try and keep everyone happy. And you realize pretty quickly that there's no way to keep everyone happy.

you have to keep everyone engaged, or at least that's what it feels like. What would you say to that statement?

Tim Samson (45:28.262)
It might come back. Give it a second.

John Pendergrast (45:32.407)
It's been seeming like there's been internet issues for the entire time, but I know it's self-cashing on the local side.

Tim Samson (45:37.508)
Yeah.

I open it, but I'll...

John Pendergrast (45:45.903)
I don't know about you. he's back.

Tim Samson (45:47.76)
No.

Tim Samson (45:54.16)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (45:55.885)
Yeah, you said something truly profound and we didn't get it. So could you start it all again?

Tim Samson (46:00.625)
Ha ha ha.

Well, let's go back. Let's go back to the intro. We'll start it there.

John Pendergrast (46:08.397)
Yeah, no.

Tim Samson (46:21.51)
Mm. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (46:28.151)
Yeah, that would be great.

Tim Samson (46:57.061)
Thank

Tim Samson (47:04.832)
Thank

Tim Samson (47:36.901)
you

Tim Samson (47:40.997)
I'm I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna take a son rabbit hole here because I actually have a question that I'm really curious about Sean how you would approach this You have someone who's not a fit in the organization right that you've you've identified them as Detrimental to the culture right, but they're a high performer Right like they they service the guests. Well, they do everything that you need

What'd do?

Tim Samson (49:02.308)
Thanks

Tim Samson (49:33.54)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (49:36.868)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (49:43.554)
Right, go.

Tim Samson (50:02.243)
and talking about the impact of COVID-19 on

Tim Samson (50:13.668)
Yeah, and I would I would suspect this happens at most organizations and most attractions at times like someone is just isn't in a fit. And we've talked a lot about building culture, but this is almost like the nurturing part, right? Right?

Tim Samson (50:43.117)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (50:56.92)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (51:17.581)
Good luck.

John Pendergrast (51:29.903)
So how do you, I mean, 100%.

I feel like, I mean, I feel a little bit like I'm sitting at the feet of like a supreme leader of understanding all this is really great. I'm really enjoying it. I'm like, oh, I'm going to learn so much. It's great. And I know that that's like the most insulting thing you can say to Australian is to compliment them. I apologize. I have a very close Australian friend and he always yells at me whenever I give him compliments. So take that as you will.

Tim Samson (51:56.034)
You

John Pendergrast (52:05.839)
But I'll say this, so a lot of attractions, especially in the mid-market, are families. They're family attractions. They've been around for 60, 80, 90 years. And it's their brothers and sisters and cousins, and it's all in the family, that kind of thing. And yet you have a marketing person, or you have someone who is just...

wildly toxic or massively underperforming. What on earth do you suggest to leaders in those organizations to say, here's how you get better?

Tim Samson (53:15.01)
So.

John Pendergrast (53:15.865)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (53:28.258)
Happy.

John Pendergrast (53:33.369)
Yeah. Yeah.

Tim Samson (53:37.79)
Okay, that's two. Pause.

Tim Samson (54:06.774)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (54:16.783)
Yeah, it is.

Tim Samson (54:59.424)
and I'm just making it right.

you

Tim Samson (55:29.984)
Thank you.

John Pendergrast (55:42.339)
Yeah, no, that's, I mean, listen, great answer. I certainly have seen that.

Tim Samson (55:43.2)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (55:51.181)
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Tim, what else? I mean, I almost feel like at this point in time, to a certain extent, I want to just set you free to start answering questions that we haven't asked, Sean. But we'll keep asking questions to keep the conversation moving. But if you suddenly go, have this thing I want to drop on you, I'd love to.

Tim Samson (55:59.264)
You

Tim Samson (56:10.099)
Yeah. I mean, I feel like I feel like we're getting so much insight. Like I'm very much with you, John. Like, like I've heard Sean speak before at things, but but I feel like we've really gotten to dig into some things that we haven't made it through, like half of the stuff we were going to ask you. So so that's part of it. But just to kind of riff off, you know, the family situation, I think that it's not limited to family orcs. Right.

John Pendergrast (56:18.393)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (56:29.166)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (56:39.24)
You have these larger orgs and lots of times departments become families right and then you could have a family member right within that department that. It is toxic and you kind of have to do the same thing with it, but you don't want to because you feel like their family, know so.

Yeah, I just want to make that comparison. There's no question there. That was just a random fleeting thought in my head, so.

John Pendergrast (57:06.211)
This is happening to both of us now where we're...

Tim Samson (57:09.536)
You

John Pendergrast (57:10.403)
Go ahead, John.

Tim Samson (57:44.35)
Okay.

Tim Samson (57:57.216)
Thank

John Pendergrast (58:06.841)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (58:30.527)
Okay.

Tim Samson (58:49.927)
you

Tim Samson (59:38.335)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:00:02.191)
Okay, yeah, I think that's a great question. Thanks, Jerry. So with what we've spoken about already in the various areas of like, here's the problem definitions. How do you start the process of solving it? Obviously, you have to have a team that's willing to say we have a problem and we need some help. What's your process? How do you go after solving some of these things?

Tim Samson (01:00:03.326)
Okay.

Tim Samson (01:00:29.79)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:00:48.91)
Right.

John Pendergrast (01:01:26.82)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (01:01:55.007)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:02:06.5)
Right.

Tim Samson (01:02:17.277)
Thank

Tim Samson (01:03:37.117)
Okay. Okay.

Thank you.

John Pendergrast (01:04:39.091)
huh.

Tim Samson (01:04:39.921)
Bye.

John Pendergrast (01:04:53.262)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:05:29.915)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:05:44.675)
Well said.

John Pendergrast (01:05:48.985)
Yeah, that's a scorecard, right? Like that gives people an opportunity to be a little competitive, but also to be a part of the equation. Jerry's suggesting we move on to another section, but I have one other question before we do that. And I know we're running a little shy on time, but you have a big focus on safety culture and really trying to think about how to have a safe culture for the people involved.

Tim Samson (01:05:52.379)
and

Tim Samson (01:06:11.003)
you

John Pendergrast (01:06:14.389)
That's, I mean, given present political climes of which we are not going to speak at all, that is a loaded phrase, and I'm curious how you define that.

Tim Samson (01:07:14.235)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (01:07:31.035)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:07:47.843)
Yeah, that makes sense. Appreciate that.

John Pendergrast (01:07:53.302)
You want to move the song?

Tim Samson (01:07:54.139)
Yeah, sorry. was well, I was just thinking about one thing and I I paused because I hate talking about this time. Right. But, you know, during during COVID and post COVID, you urged leaders to over communicate. Right. Of what's going on. What did that what that teach us as an industry about cultural resilience within these orgs that basically shut down for a bit?

Tim Samson (01:08:23.789)
Scare Noir.

Tim Samson (01:08:27.688)
All right. You probably didn't hear any of it.

Tim Samson (01:08:35.928)
Yeah, that was about it. That was all I asked. No. So, know, you know, during that time that we don't speak of COVID, you urged leaders to over communicate things that were going on. What do you think that taught us as an industry about the resilience of culture in general, especially being that there was a disconnect for a period of time?

Tim Samson (01:09:31.456)
Point.

Tim Samson (01:10:19.083)
Yeah, I think that kind of rolls into.

I think that was a lesson for the for the industry in general. Like it was a lesson for everyone, you know, and about resilience and the kind of service and lots of different aspects. It completely changed guest experience, right? Like technology was adopted at a huge rate. But but I tend to think about, you know, the I think you call it the spirit of an organization, right? Like where culture seeps into the guests, right?

I think that we can tell when something's authentic as humans, right? And we know when something's manufactured. Organizations like Disney have done a really good job of that authenticity, even though we know it's all like it's storytelling, but because the culture is so strong, they've been able to develop that authenticity. What recommendations could you give to operators to keep consistency within the culture?

Keep the authenticity. And are there any examples from organizations that you've helped or come across in your travels?

Tim Samson (01:12:47.0)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (01:13:03.141)
Thank you. you.

Okay.

Okay. Okay.

Tim Samson (01:14:29.1)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:14:32.003)
Yeah, reminds me of the Dale Carnegie, how to make friends and influence people. Like that idea of, you know, that you don't ever give someone a compliment that's like, good job. You always be like very specific about what you're complimenting them about.

Tim Samson (01:14:32.279)
you

John Pendergrast (01:14:45.583)
for that same reason and that idea of smile and say their name is the most influential word in their life and you those kinds of things. I think it's fascinating to see how those things have been kind of universal truths that carry forward and are so useful inside organizations and are probably not unforced or at least underlined enough to really, we need to be reminded on a regular basis and I appreciate that.

Tim Samson (01:14:49.206)
huh. Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:15:18.989)
Right.

Tim Samson (01:15:43.958)
Thank you.

Tim Samson (01:16:24.855)
Thank

Tim Samson (01:16:33.1)
you

John Pendergrast (01:16:33.647)
Yeah, totally. I'll say it this way, you are both a very engaging and fun individual to interview and also a very hard interview. And I'll tell you why. I'm watching Tim and I'm watching myself on the camera occasionally and I'm seeing us pause, look up to the right as we're processing what you're saying and going.

Tim Samson (01:16:36.31)
you

you

Tim Samson (01:16:53.318)
Okay.

John Pendergrast (01:16:55.151)
Oh, I need to think about that a little bit. And so I'm having this great opportunity to learn at the same time as to kind of think about, how would I apply that?

In my own, like, of Rocky Res or inside of, like, how we work with our own teams, and it's just fascinating to listen to, we're gonna transition to what we call the lightning round, which is a terrible misnaming of what it actually is. And what I'm gonna tell you just to take away any of the pressure and stress is, Tim and I ruin the lightning round every single time by talking too much.

Tim Samson (01:17:06.322)
and

John Pendergrast (01:17:29.359)
Because the purpose of the lightning round is simply to ask questions and get a quick answer. But it's never our visitor that is the problem. It is always us. So we're going to kick off the lightning round, and then you're going to watch the spectacular failure. Although we're going to be optimistic that this time's the time we're going to get it right. So it's a theme we have going.

Tim Samson (01:17:31.414)
Thank

Tim Samson (01:17:56.297)
It's the only thing we do consistently.

John Pendergrast (01:17:58.392)
Yeah, okay, here we go.

best attraction you've ever visited purely for fun.

Tim Samson (01:18:14.119)
NNNN

John Pendergrast (01:18:19.119)
That's cool. I haven't checked that one out yet. I'm looking forward to it.

Tim Samson (01:18:22.708)
Hire for attitude or skills.

John Pendergrast (01:18:42.807)
Most overrated training exercise.

Tim Samson (01:19:02.002)
Hahaha!

John Pendergrast (01:19:06.061)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:19:06.324)
Take them out of the place with guests and bring them somewhere there's none. Yes. I was, I never did that. I was a marketer. never did that. I promise you that. Biggest hiring mistake you see.

John Pendergrast (01:19:10.733)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:19:32.847)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (01:19:54.75)
Very nice.

John Pendergrast (01:20:01.053)
training seasonal staff essential or nice to have?

Tim Samson (01:20:33.492)
Best way to keep seasonal workers returning year after year.

Tim Samson (01:20:43.228)
Money?

Tim Samson (01:21:03.016)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:21:20.335)
Most underutilized tool for building culture.

Tim Samson (01:21:45.905)
Okay.

Tim Samson (01:22:01.725)
Hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:22:12.42)
improvement but measured improvement yeah

Tim Samson (01:22:13.873)
Yeah. Well, I think of the see here I go. I'm running it. You know, I think of the importance of having having cultural KPIs in your business KPIs for the year, right? I don't think that we too many organizations think about that at that level, but. Best way to recognize employees.

John Pendergrast (01:23:13.548)
one leadership.

John Pendergrast (01:23:19.906)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:23:23.511)
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, One leadership quality every future leader should have.

John Pendergrast (01:23:42.191)
It is, right? I know.

Tim Samson (01:24:17.778)
you

Tim Samson (01:24:28.722)
We didn't do too bad. We didn't do too bad on lightning. This is the best we've done.

John Pendergrast (01:24:35.247)
Amazing. No. Yeah, it's true.

Tim Samson (01:24:43.346)
I think we need to name it something other than lightning because I don't think that was lightning.

John Pendergrast (01:24:48.291)
Well, Jerry can confirm one way the other, but I think that's the best he does.

Tim Samson (01:24:51.953)
Yeah, so, so we got a couple more questions for me and then we'll let you go. Right. you know, you've built the, what did John say? Yes. No. so you, you've built a career on helping people deliver, you know, these magical experiences and there are a lot of operators. I hope, I hope there's a lot of operators listening right now, but for those operators, that's better.

For those operators who are listening right now who are either thinking about culture and things that they can change now and year round operations or those in seasonal operations that are thinking about how can we implement change next year? What's the one thing that they should start doing next week or tomorrow to effect change?

Tim Samson (01:26:31.952)
you

Tim Samson (01:26:35.774)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (01:26:45.489)
Thank

Okay.

Tim Samson (01:26:59.857)
you

Tim Samson (01:27:22.705)
Thank

Tim Samson (01:27:28.625)
Thank Okay.

Okay.

Tim Samson (01:28:14.191)
Thanks.

Good morning.

John Pendergrast (01:28:28.239)
I mean that leads into the follow on question that I would have asked is, what qualities do you see in the next gen leaders, the next gen attraction leaders, what are they gonna need most in managing their teams and how do you cultivate that? Now, and you've answered a little bit of it, but how are you looking at the next gen leaders? The leaders of 10 years from now, how do we cultivate those? How do we cultivate those people?

Tim Samson (01:28:43.119)
you

Tim Samson (01:29:00.943)
you

Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:29:11.895)
Right. Right.

Tim Samson (01:29:16.879)
you

Tim Samson (01:29:24.876)
Thank Thank

Tim Samson (01:30:08.417)
Okay.

Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:30:53.059)
Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

Tim Samson (01:30:56.335)
Yeah, I think you just answered my question. So my last question. So I'm going to phrase it a little bit differently, right? I want to give you the opportunity to leave a final thought for leaders in our industry about culture. What would that be?

Tim Samson (01:31:23.073)
It's just final for this podcast. It's not your final thought. Just so we're clear. Right?

Tim Samson (01:31:52.75)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (01:31:58.04)
That's awesome. You know, I really appreciate what you do for the industry and how you've helped organizations grow their culture. Really enjoyed the time that we spent today and I hope that everyone listening also did. So thanks for coming on, cloning around with us a little bit.

I don't know why, but thank you once again for joining us.

John Pendergrast (01:32:24.931)
Yeah, it's been a real pleasure meeting with you.

John Pendergrast (01:32:36.173)
Yeah, thanks very much.

Tim Samson (01:32:36.406)
Yep. yeah. So, you know, just for those listening themes we explored today, you know, why, why culture is not an accident. how, how investing in training pays off in the long run, leadership strategies and working through that and, building resilient organizations that can have meaningful culture. So appreciate everything, Sean, and hope you have a great night.

John Pendergrast (01:33:06.957)
Or morning, yeah.

Tim Samson (01:33:07.362)
Morning. Yeah, morning. I don't know what time it is. I only slept for an hour.
