John Pendergrast (00:04.785)
Okay, well, welcome here, Sarah. We're really excited to have you. This podcast process is something that we really enjoy doing and we love talking to different people about what they do and what they love. And so I just wanted to say thanks for joining us today. know Tim, you want to add anything here?

Tim Samson (00:29.513)
No, you know, Sarah, I've known you for a couple of years, a few years now, and I've just always found your story and really you just incredible with the stuff that you've accomplished. So I'm super excited to have you join us today.

Sara Schiller (00:45.474)
Thank you. Well, I'm excited and I, you know Tim, you held my hand when we jumped into dynamic pricing two years ago. So I think we have a level of trust that's pretty deep after that time together.

John Pendergrast (01:02.805)
For sure. So maybe we kick off today, and I think a really great podcast is just a really great conversation. And I've watched a bunch of podcasts over the years, and the ones that are really formula and structure tend to be the ones I'm like, I don't know. But the ones that are really engaging conversations is where I really like to sit. So maybe we start off with just having a good old-fashioned conversation. So your origin story is a story that is like,

It's got adversity in it. It's got like these highs and lows. You've got these moments where you're like, you suddenly realize that this, you know, this slime wasn't just a toy. This thing that you were doing wasn't just a toy, but actually had something magic to it. Do you want to walk us through a little bit of that?

Sara Schiller (01:44.278)
Yeah, yeah, so we call it a darkness to light story. Because it gets pretty dark in the beginning and we want people to know that it gets better. But my, my co founder Karen and I have been friends for 17 years. We have met over a joint collect.

a joint passion over contemporary arts. We used to go see a lot of art together. And 17 years ago, my older daughter was born with a rare genetic syndrome called Angelman syndrome. It really provided a lot of limitations. She's profoundly disabled. She can't speak. She can't do any activities of daily living. But a symptom of her syndrome is happiness. So she wakes up every day.

um joyful to see the world and it's lovely to have her as part of my family. Fast forward to 11 years ago, my husband of decades woke up at the age of 50 and he had a massive bilateral stroke and he ended up profoundly disabled, unable to speak, unable to do any activities of daily living. And then three years after that, Karen's husband,

lost his life due to a severe depression and mental illness. And then nine months after that, her cousin was murdered in the Parkland school shooting. So as friends, you know who your friends are when you go through major trauma.

John Pendergrast (03:13.429)
Wow.

Tim Samson (03:14.228)
you

John Pendergrast (03:19.699)
Yeah. Yeah.

Sara Schiller (03:21.314)
And I like to think too that also when you're down and out, like you can really trust someone. And Karen was at her house when a friend came over with her 10 year old daughter and she had slime with her and Karen was playing with her daughter after being severely depressed herself and just almost unable to carry on.

And the next thing she knew, her friend was leaving. And she's like, why are you leaving? You just got here. And she's like, you've been playing with my daughter for four hours. And Karen was like, what? I feel really good. I got to bring this to Sarah. So she started to become what's known as an adult slimer, ordering slime from all over the internet, from Etsy sites.

John Pendergrast (03:55.871)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (04:04.168)
Ha ha ha ha ha!

John Pendergrast (04:04.254)
You

Sara Schiller (04:07.592)
She brought it to me and my two girls. So I had my older one who's disabled and my younger one. And we would just sit there and talk and play. what we realized one day is that my older daughter with the syndrome...

was playing equally with my typically developing daughter and they were having a relationship and connecting over slime. And it was at that moment that we said, we have to bring this everywhere. This is something for adults. It's for families to come together. It's about connecting with yourself like Karen did originally and connecting with others like we saw my daughters doing.

I think when the light bulb went off, a year later we opened our doors. Everything from raising money, writing the business plan, designing it, building it, launching it, the works.

John Pendergrast (04:55.829)
So that's an incredible story. And it's more of a story, you lived it, you are living it. How did you find hope in the middle of that? All that's going on, was it that moment you saw people losing themselves in what you're doing and finding their own happiness there? Where was that moment you went, okay, I see hope rising again? Because I feel like there must have been some parts in there that were pretty hopeless.

Sara Schiller (05:26.698)
One thing that I found out through this process is I'm super optimistic. So I think hopefulness is inside me. And I think for any entrepreneur out there, you wake up thinking things are going to work, because otherwise you wouldn't do crazy things. And opening an experience, an immersive experience around slime is crazy. If we knew what we were doing or

John Pendergrast (05:40.757)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (05:55.566)
You know, no one normal would do this. It's a true act of hopefulness, of hopefulness, right? So, I don't think we really, really knew what we were building until we opened our door on the first day and we had 3,000 people outside.

John Pendergrast (05:59.753)
Ha

Tim Samson (06:01.683)
you

John Pendergrast (06:03.647)
Can confirm.

Tim Samson (06:05.361)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (06:21.43)
And Karen and I were inside at what we call Lake Sloomoo which is a lake of 300 gallons of slime. And these kids were just jumping up and down and up and down. And she and I held hands and started crying because we realized like we had done it. We had brought this to the world and other people liked it too. So it was, it was a great feeling. And the reason I like to tell the story about

John Pendergrast (06:43.082)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (06:48.97)
our friendship and what we went through is it's hard to do something that's never been done before if you don't have complete trust with your co-founder. And Karen and I have this level of trust that's, it's unbelievable.

John Pendergrast (07:04.191)
Yeah, that's cool. I agree about the part about you can't be a normal person if you're gonna be an entrepreneur. There's something inherently right or inherently wrong about you and maybe both in that and how that works.

Tim Samson (07:15.815)
Yeah, we often ask people, especially in the attractions industry, like, when did you fall in love? Like, when did you fall in love with slime during this process? Because there had to be a tipping point.

Sara Schiller (07:29.486)
So I fell in love with slime when Karen brought over a butter slime that smelled like Froot Loops. And I was in my late 40s, I'm now in my 50s, and I was taken back from the smell of Froot Loops to my seven-year-old self. I have two brothers. My mom bought one box of sugar cereal every two weeks, and we're fighting over, you we just, would eat the whole box in one.

Saturday morning cartoon sitting. And that was a great memory for me and the slime triggered it. It also really makes you feel good by playing with slime. So it's releasing endorphins and dopamine in your brain. So between the scent and that butter slime, which is a creamy, squishy, lovely slime, I was hooked.

Tim Samson (08:18.451)
was very cool. I remember when I heard about Sloomoo and I was having difficulty pronouncing the name. I didn't quite know how to pronounce it in general, but from day one, you you guys chose the name Sloomoo Institute. Not a museum, not a playground, not a attraction, not a thing. It feels very deliberate. Like, what was the thought process behind that?

John Pendergrast (08:20.127)
very cool.

Sara Schiller (08:45.292)
Yeah, so we took a long time figuring out our name. I have since found out that a lot of entrepreneurs hire naming companies, which Karen and I did not do. But in 2017, there was an amazing trend in the slime community. And the slime community is really an incredible group of diverse people. And the trend was get your slime name by replacing the vowels of your name with double O. So.

Sarah becomes Tsuru, Tim becomes Toom, John becomes June. And we knew, we always knew when we were launching Sloomoo that it was gonna be more than just slime. So calling it Sloomoo made a lot of sense. Sloomoo is the slime name for slime.

And what we love to say is that it gives people permission to play. So when you come into Sloomoo you get your slime name. And a lot of people really transform themselves into someone else when they change their name. And we love it when people come in with their grandfather, who's known as Papa, and they become Pooh Pooh. And we still get letters from kids.

John Pendergrast (09:50.773)
Hahaha!

Tim Samson (09:51.579)
Ha ha ha!

Sara Schiller (09:55.926)
they're calling their grandpa or their papa, you know, poo poo for years. It is stuck. So that was an important part. And then we did also spend a lot of time thinking about museum. And for us, institutes seem to make sense because it taps into all the science behind slum.

Slime is a non-Newtonian particle. It's not a liquid or a solid. It's a craft that you make in a slime kitchen. It's a polymer. It has all these great attributes.

John Pendergrast (10:20.607)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (10:31.618)
There's also a really lovely part of having an institute around slime because we attract a lot of young girls. And as a nerdy girl, science girl myself, I think it's kind of cool to lean into that. Well, nerdy girls are cool too. You can love science and math and still be hip and cool,

John Pendergrast (10:38.984)
Mmm.

John Pendergrast (10:48.233)
Yeah, STEM. Yeah. That's really cool. So your mission is deliver joy. And clearly that's what you're doing for people. That poo poo, I think that's hilarious. That like, and that grandma's moo moo. I don't, like there's, it's great. What, like how do you track KPIs around deliver joy? Like what is the KPI that you track that goes, we're doing it?

Sara Schiller (10:57.24)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (11:04.514)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (11:16.13)
That's a really good question. We probably revert back to what more traditional attractions, experiences, or retailers use. So we're tapping into mystery shop scores. We're tapping into our MPS scores. So we do like hard data. We love data around here. And we want to get that.

John Pendergrast (11:27.263)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (11:41.01)
survey data, we get a lot of handwritten letters. So the one thing that you may remember in the back of your mind when you're around seven or eight years old, one of your school projects is to learn how to write a letter and mail it. So we get a lot of mail, which is really, really fun, the cutest stuff ever.

John Pendergrast (11:55.315)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (11:59.524)
Ha ha ha.

Sara Schiller (12:03.758)
We're tracking our Google scores. We're tracking our customer satisfaction from a numbers perspective. But I think all you have to do is visit the locations and stand there and watch, and you can really feel people coming together.

John Pendergrast (12:20.071)
Mm-hmm. That's cool. It's really interesting to see when people are engaged in something and they lock in on something, it's like everything else just kind of fades away. And you can see that they're just super focused. You see it. I remember doing it with my kids, going to these kinds of like really kid-focused or really like...

knowledge focus we went to a lot of like kids museums and things like that and you'd see your kid lock in and then you'd lock in and then you'd be like okay hold on it's it's it's two o'clock in the afternoon we should probably get some lunch you know like these moments

Sara Schiller (12:53.484)
Yeah, the great thing about slime also is that you have to use both your hands. So you can't be on your phone. So it's great for adults because they're forced to put their phones in their pockets. And the kids really, really notice that their parents are connecting with them. One of my favorite audiences that come in are

John Pendergrast (13:03.221)
rate.

Sara Schiller (13:19.124)
these like dads with their daughters, single dads with their daughters, macho, you know, cool guys who are like, well, I'm not really going to touch the slime. I'm just here for my daughter. And 20 feet in the experience, you see them like grinning and stretching and pulling and they'll leave saying like, I needed this more than my kid. Like this was awesome. And they're caught off guard. And there's a beauty in

John Pendergrast (13:36.117)
You

Tim Samson (13:36.644)
Sara Schiller (13:47.822)
in having children because they do allow you to do things that either you forgot how to play or you forgot to do and they they it gets you to you know surprise yourself with how much fun you can have because we've all forgotten how to play.

John Pendergrast (13:54.42)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (14:03.635)
Yeah, well, we all have an inner nine-year-old, right? There's that inner nine-year-old that never goes away, but we don't live that life anymore. We don't really have that freedom to do that very often. And I can definitely see how that would come out in those environments, because what else are gonna do? Stand around and not engage? I don't know how you don't engage with that, especially with that much joy in the room. It's contagious. Yeah, it's cool.

Tim Samson (14:24.046)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (14:26.678)
Yeah. So we launched a new exhibit today in New York that starts to take slime and transforms it into other things. So it's a room when you walk in, it has a table with 10 different vats of slime. And when you touch the slime, the energy that's in your body, that's in the water in your body is transferred into the water that's in the slime.

that's transferred into the copper bowl that has a reader on the bottom of it that you can't see. The reader triggers lights to come out from your bowl and on above you on the ceiling. And each bowl has a different musical instrument that turns on. And as you play, the more you play, the more the beat starts. And if you have 10 people in the room, the whole song is going and the whole table and ceiling starts.

Tim Samson (15:12.056)
You

Sara Schiller (15:22.862)
spinning in rainbow colors. So it's disco slime, it's grooves, groovy grove, and it's tapping this into this science slime music, obviously sent from the slime, and then just visually it's this candy store.

John Pendergrast (15:25.001)
You got disco slime.

John Pendergrast (15:44.671)
Man, I gotta get to New York. Tim, we're gonna have to book some time in New York.

Tim Samson (15:50.38)
Yeah, or Atlanta or Chicago or Houston or LA. Yeah, LA. Yeah. You I think it's really a, you mentioned how parents become involved. You you go into these experience thinking it's going to be all about the kids and then the parents end up becoming involved. I think that's a testament to how you guys have built the whole experience and the careful thought behind everything that you've put into it. And you mentioned

John Pendergrast (15:53.477)
Chicago's closer or LA yeah yeah

Sara Schiller (15:54.018)
We're LA.

Tim Samson (16:18.209)
They put their phones away because you need two hands, right? But this trend came from social media, right? Which is directly from phones. So the Satisfying Slime video was born on phones, but then you translated that digital piece into something that's become not digital, where you don't want the digital piece in your hand, right? While you're experiencing the traction. How did you do that at scale?

Sara Schiller (16:45.112)
Well, also, all, yeah, when we did something really conscious that I think most people won't notice, but they'll feel, which is we really pioneered the experiential entertainment retail space to be for adults in a visual language perspective. So,

Taking in our love of contemporary art, we wanted to create a space that adults would feel really good in. A building, the vats, the custom vats that we have for our slime are like these gorgeous statues almost. And we like to say, well, you could put slime in a trash can and kids would love it. But when you put it in these custom vats,

The adults are like, hmm, I guess this is for me. When they see our curvy walls that really tap into the slimy nature of slime, everything is elevated and sophisticated. So you don't feel like you're going into a play space or a children's playground. You actually feel like you're going into a museum.

and then it happens to have all this crazy fun slime in there. we're tapping into that design sense that people have.

John Pendergrast (18:05.685)
That's interesting. So you built the intention of creating a space that adults would be comfortable in and then layered kids into it in a way that they could, that's really smart. Like really, really smart way of approaching that because then, because there's lots of kid places that adults are like, my goodness.

that's a lot of neon, or that's a lot of flashing lights, or that's a lot of like kind of difficult things as an adult to process. But kids love. I love that you've done that because that also, yeah, I just think that's a really interesting idea.

Sara Schiller (18:30.732)
Mm-hmm

Sara Schiller (18:43.704)
Well, it makes sense because Karen and I were the ones that first fell in love with the slime as adults. As adults, yeah.

Tim Samson (18:47.469)
You

John Pendergrast (18:47.829)
Right, yeah, of course. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool. Who are your, so this is totally off topic, but who are your favorite contemporary artists? I'm just curious. Do you have some favorites?

Sara Schiller (19:01.222)
boy. So, well, I will just start by telling you that for over a decade, I was the mouthpiece for the global street art movement. So in the early aughts, we did major, major exhibitions, published books, spoke around the world on creativity from street art as a passion project. So this was just my side gig.

John Pendergrast (19:12.456)
Okay.

Sara Schiller (19:28.842)
So I love artists like JR, Shepherd Ferry, Swoon, all the artists who really looked at public space, architecture, and cities and how people were moving through cities to be a part of the piece of art they were creating. And I think that influence and that love really...

works well when you're creating an immersive experience because if you take that street art passion of mine combined with my background at Starwood Hotels focusing on the guest experience, we've curated from the moment you approach the building a guest experience that taps into your senses, visually what the journey is, and then what the actual experience is from beginning to end.

John Pendergrast (20:22.397)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm glad I asked that question because I immediately did some Googling and pulled up those artists and Swoon is incredible. So I'm gonna go explore a little bit on that after. It's funny because I mean, you're such an art-based mindset. Like I can see that you're just, you're an artist yourself. I don't know if you also create art, but clearly you're creating an art of sorts.

Sara Schiller (20:30.807)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (20:47.829)
and the definition of art is well beyond the scope of what we can talk about in this podcast, because I think that's a pretty broad definition. But when you think about how you're going on the business side, so you're acquiring customers, and that had to have been the side that you're like, okay, there's things to learn here. 75 % of your acquisition right now is coming through organic social, right? So you're pulling people in through organic social.

How do you balance creating analog experiences, these kind of really tactile analog experiences, with the digital shareability? How do you bring these things together? Because we're just inundated by videos on our phones, and now AI is creating even more digital garbage. So how do you manage to bridge that?

Sara Schiller (21:23.981)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (21:35.766)
Yeah, so.

The good news is I have a genius business partner in Karen who really created the field of influencer marketing. And that's what she was doing before she and I joined Hands and built Sloomoo. So she fundamentally understands influencers and how people think and move online as part of her DNA. And from the very, very beginning, we focused on creating meaningful content.

Tim Samson (21:42.22)
you

John Pendergrast (21:57.343)
Music.

Sara Schiller (22:06.96)
We are always creating reasons for people to come back because we don't want to have to keep acquiring, right? We know how expensive that is, so trying to get the repeat visitor rate up. And doing that with almost a continuous stream of activations, which result in a lot of content that we can put online that people love.

The one that we have going right now is called a PSA to play. It's a public service announcement from kids to adults saying, you know, make sure you take time out of your day to play. And for us, we want people to play with sign, but that could mean just having a dance party or, you know, running down the supermarket aisle and shouting with joy. So, and.

John Pendergrast (22:35.796)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (22:56.97)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (22:57.258)
It's been so cute, the kids are so cute, but also we have people coming into this space. have these big walls that people are drawing on and writing on and messaging, and we have coloring sheets. So we're doing things that seem so basic, but people then take that and they share it online and it just grows.

Tim Samson (23:19.647)
Yeah, it's really fascinating. You launched the original location, New York location, four months before COVID. And then the world shut down. I think as an industry in attractions and passenger vessels and tours, it was really an unsure time for everyone. And we were trying to think, like, how do we get through it?

But you guys did something really smart you you pivoted the virtual camps for companies like Google's and What's the most important lesson you learned during that period your business is just getting started and You're hit with this adversity not that Your life didn't have adversity before it, you know, but this is different. This isn't a business perspective

Sara Schiller (24:06.2)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (24:09.518)
Well, I think it taps into those parts of you being an entrepreneur that you may not know you have, which is that fearlessness without being reckless, I hope. And we were fearless to experiment.

And we just, we literally turned on initially summer camps for kids. And we, we made up what a camp looks like and Karen and I were doing the camps. mean, it was us. And the next thing we know, there were these communities all over the U S of young kids who were knowing each other through the digital camps, but also their parents were like, wow.

I can make dinner while my kid is on this online camp. And so we'd see the parents in the background cooking and baking and helping and watching. those parents then were like, we need to do a family day at Google, at Bank of America. So those companies were like, let's do family Zooms, because everyone was on Zoom. And we started making slime with them.

We also even did digital walkthroughs of the space with some of our corporate clients. So we would take a whole team through Slimoo digitally. But we failed at things too. I always like to bring up our failures because no one wants to talk about them. We launched an in-home brochure to sell slime because we're like, okay, we should be selling slime to every home in America. Everyone needs it. And we put together a

John Pendergrast (25:28.629)
Yep.

Tim Samson (25:40.134)
Ha

Sara Schiller (25:44.61)
gorgeous little brochure that got mailed out, 80,000 people or something, crazy number. And we were working with a company that has a lot, works with a lot of lists of families in our target audience. And the day that it hit in home was the day that the Black Lives Matter protests started.

John Pendergrast (26:08.276)
No.

Sara Schiller (26:10.338)
The company said they had never seen in their 15 years of being open a worst performing mailer ever, ever.

Like literally we flushed the money down the drain. Like there was no coming back for it. There's no messaging you can say to follow up from something that really tapped into so many people and was so tragic. So we just moved on. We continued to move on and when we could open our doors we did and we let in, you know, 20 people an hour. And again, Karen and I were there manning the store, manning it, working ourselves. We had taken the team down.

John Pendergrast (26:25.941)
Thank

John Pendergrast (26:43.391)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (26:48.743)
wiping down things. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Sara Schiller (26:51.724)
Yeah. But what's been this like blessing in disguise with the pandemic besides keeping us super, super thin, like we're, we're, are very hungry and thin as just as a company. But the blessing in disguise was that people needed slime more than ever when they got back, when they were allowed to be free, because they now just been on their devices for three months, six months a year.

And what would you want more than to put your device down and go hang with your kids and do something really fun? So we actually really popped out, like we popped out of the pandemic in an amazing way.

John Pendergrast (27:36.051)
Yeah, it's so interesting how there was such a desperate need for people after that, you know, I call it the time.

shall not be named, but COVID. But there's such a need for people and also such a, I don't know how we do it. What are we gonna do? And so I can see how slime would be that thing that's really different that also brings people together. just, I can see why it suddenly became really popular all of a sudden. I can see how that would play out. You know, I think, go ahead.

Tim Samson (27:46.506)
No!

Sara Schiller (28:04.16)
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And that, I was just gonna say that fearlessness then kind of took us through to things on the other end where a year later we opened, or two years later, I guess, we opened two locations on the same day. We opened Chicago and Atlanta on the same day, and I still don't know why we didn't think that was crazy.

But we were like, have to get open. We need to make money and we need to grow. And with construction delays and everything that happened, like they both basically finished at the same time. So we opened the doors on the same day on a Saturday and we were in one location and then we flew to the next location on Sunday.

John Pendergrast (28:51.071)
Did, okay, so I was like, did Karen go to one and you stayed at the other? Or no, you just... That makes sense, that makes sense. Yeah, that absolutely makes sense. So I mean, a lot of major attractions, license and franchise, and go through that process.

Sara Schiller (28:56.108)
We couldn't separate. We had to be together.

Tim Samson (28:58.856)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (29:09.557)
You've kind of built an entire like well you built a slum averse. I don't know if I'm saying exactly correct Yeah, the slum averse. It's just it has its own mascot It's got like all these different things you took this kind of like you created IP from the concept of joy and you've gone ahead and like now you're going from feeling to fictional world like This process how on earth do you like do you do you look at and go? We're gonna figure out a franchise model someday or is this like you're gonna run this

Sara Schiller (29:15.266)
That's what we call it, yep.

John Pendergrast (29:39.872)
The way it feels like you're have to run this yourself in many different ways for a long time maybe forever

Sara Schiller (29:47.252)
I hope not. But I will tell you what the strategy is because Karen and I, with our different backgrounds, we've had a strategy from day one.

Tim Samson (29:49.511)
you

John Pendergrast (29:58.165)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (29:58.65)
And so none of this is by accident. The experiences in North America or the five in the US, we do own and we manage and that is very deliberate. We want to control the guest experience to the nth degree. And we know that by creating an unbelievable guest experience, we're getting an emotional connection and building a brand. So building that brand is top, you know, in the totem pole of things that we want to do.

John Pendergrast (30:25.642)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (30:27.234)
We want to license internationally. So we are willing to license. And they'll be licensing the IP, which is not just the character Sloomoo. So Sloomoo is a character, but also a species, which I'll get into in a second. So we want to license the visual IP components, but also the recipes, the operating procedures.

Tim Samson (30:42.061)
Hahahaha

Sara Schiller (30:56.072)
the ordering of all the supplies, the vats, slumu falls where you put on a biodegradable poncho and have falls dumped on you is run with like pharmaceutical grade pumps. So someone's getting the full experience when they license and we have deals that we're working on in Europe and the Middle East. So we will let it go.

and people can bring it to life in other countries. We can't control it everywhere. But we're also focused on taking Sloomoo, the character, and bringing her to life.

John Pendergrast (31:25.098)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (31:35.47)
through media. So we have a graphic novel that we're working on. And what's so incredible about this novel and this story, you really can't make this up, but the woman who went to Karen's apartment with her 10 year old has 22 New York Times bestselling novels in the young adult space and is now our writer for our graphic novel. Yeah.

Tim Samson (31:58.726)
Ha ha ha.

Sara Schiller (32:00.694)
And she's a stroke survivor and like just so much joy and love with the team that we've built and we're on this journey with, which is so cool. So the graphic novel, we have a series of novels. We're actually working on the third one, even though the first one hasn't come out yet. Those novels will be translated and Tim, this gets back into your digital piece, into animated shorts, into animated feature films. We have a...

Spotify music channel, we're launching our album this week in conjunction with Grooves Groovy Grove. And we are gonna take that full circle, we hope, to live performance. So, you you could go to Sesame Street Live or you could go to Sloomoo Live where our characters, because we have a species, we have over a hundred characters.

are dancing, singing, playing with slime and thus fulfilling the mission of delivering joy. So that's the vision is really to take like we've created the theme park, now we're creating the movie studio.

Tim Samson (33:08.602)
Hmm.

Tim Samson (33:21.872)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (33:21.957)
I was gonna say that I'm waiting for the major theatrical release across all theaters of the Slumoo universe. Yeah, that's incredible. I'm gonna ask another question, Tim. I'm not stealing one of your questions. I'm taking us in another direction, because now really curious. So I remember as an early stage entrepreneur,

Sara Schiller (33:26.286)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (33:38.288)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

John Pendergrast (33:46.035)
making that first million dollars. We were like, okay, we made a million dollars. And that always takes longer than you think it's going to. It's like this big hill climb, you're trying to figure it out, and then you make your first million. And some people make their first million very quickly, just they hit at the right moment and it goes like that. And it's always like, well, once we make a million dollars, it's gonna be easy from here on in. I have my own opinions on this topic, but I'm very curious. Has it gotten easier? Have you arrived?

Sara Schiller (34:16.909)
So I like to say the kids are all right. We are no longer on complete panic, but I do check the bank accounts every day. And we made our first million actually really fast because this caught on like wildfire, but we lost it equally fast when we refunded hundreds of thousands of tickets when the pandemic hit. So we know what it's like.

John Pendergrast (34:25.236)
Hahaha.

John Pendergrast (34:29.351)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (34:36.468)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (34:46.836)
It's getting harder because we have to let things go. And as entrepreneurs, you you don't want to do that. Like I want to control the guest experience. So it's trusting and relying on people. We have way more moving parts than we've ever had.

John Pendergrast (35:04.614)
Mm-hmm. Yep.

Sara Schiller (35:06.722)
And, but we're having probably way more fun because we're less panicked. And that's why I say the kids are all right. Like we wake up feeling like, okay, we got this. What are we going to, what are we going to nail today?

John Pendergrast (35:20.533)
solve the problems of the day, you know, and try and plan for the problems of tomorrow. Yeah, no, I understand. I think it's, I was listening to an interview from the CEO of Nvidia, which of course is probably the world's most valuable company now. And someone asked him this question, if you knew what was going to happen, would you do it again?

Sara Schiller (35:24.974)
Mm-hmm

John Pendergrast (35:43.923)
would you do this journey again? And his answer was really interesting. He said, absolutely not. And I thought that was a fascinating thing to say when you've reached, quote unquote, the highest level of business. So how would you answer that? Yeah.

Sara Schiller (36:00.526)
I would do it again. I would do it again. And I do think starting, so this is not my first time at the rodeo, I'd started another company that I sold. I actually had to choose at one point, am I gonna keep my hospitality company I had a meetings company or Sloomoo? And I was like, okay, I'm gonna sell this company. But one of the things that Karen and I have been able to do is,

John Pendergrast (36:10.675)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (36:27.322)
work in a business that delivers joy. And I think it's most people don't wake up every day and get to do that. And we've tied in our experience into the fabric of the business. So we have a neuro diverse workforce. 10 % of our employees are on the autism spectrum or need a job coach or someone to come to work with them. I call it my pay it forward project because I hope someone hires Samantha at one point, but

John Pendergrast (36:30.868)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (36:42.057)
Hmm. Yep.

Yep.

John Pendergrast (36:55.348)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (36:56.718)
It's super cool that you can have a profitable business and literally be doing good, like giving people jobs who have no meaningful work. And, you know, I don't think I could have gone to work for American Express, but I don't think I would have been able to do that. And the same thing is true with our partnership with the Goldie Hahn Foundation that she's created called Mind Up, which...

delivers mental fitness for children. So breathing exercises, everything that can make your brain feel good when you're growing up in a really hard situation and tapping into those, two philanthropic arms has been really powerful as an entrepreneur.

John Pendergrast (37:44.341)
I, that really resonates with me and I love what you said because I feel very much the same way. I like how you answered it because the way you answered it was because of the people and because of the impact on people, that's what gets me up in the morning. And I would 100 % agree with you. I think that's also the most challenging part of business, right? Yep.

Sara Schiller (38:07.438)
The people is the hardest part. We have

We had an employee who came up to us one day. I was actually taking garbage out. She stops me at the garbage bin and says, I want to thank you for hiring me. And of course we're big enough now. I don't, I don't even know who she is. She said, I'm autistic and I always thought someone would hire me because I am autistic and I have these certain skills and no one would ever hire me. And I was about to lose my, my, my rent. Like I'm about to lose my apartment.

John Pendergrast (38:17.855)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (38:24.447)
Don't know who she is, yeah.

Tim Samson (38:25.283)
you

Sara Schiller (38:41.456)
and you guys hired me because I'm autistic and you see the traits that I have and you value them and you're putting them to good use. And if that doesn't bring a tear to your eye and make you make the whole year good, I don't know what else can. And then the opposite is true on our guest side because all of our spaces are fully capable for classrooms.

of children in wheelchairs. So we can take on, bring the class, we can take you. And for our visitors who have children on the autism spectrum or with special needs, come on in. We've got headphones, we've got nose plugs. Our staff is trained on how to work with you. You need a space to hang, come here. we...

Tim Samson (39:08.514)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (39:10.911)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (39:30.76)
want people who are shunned or turned away because we believe we can give you a great experience. And I know that we do. have so many people come back and say, this is the first time we actually felt good as a family. We didn't feel weird. We felt just, we felt great coming into Sloomoo.

John Pendergrast (39:49.781)
To me, of all things you said, that is the thing that gets you up in the morning. That ability to help like that is how I'm interpreting what you're saying. I think all great entrepreneurs that come out and build great things have to have a motive like that of some sort. And I think they're the ones that last and the ones that build things that actually change the world. And I think that's...

I think that's what you guys are building. But anyways, I've stolen Tim's question time, so I'll let him get back to it.

Tim Samson (40:20.637)
No,

Sara Schiller (40:22.638)
Hit me up, Tim.

Tim Samson (40:50.293)
You know, who might be in wheelchairs, neurodivergent, the whole thing, or the whole, the whole gauntlet of, different types of humans. And I think others in the industry would, would want to ask you, you know, how do you keep the design philosophy going in? Is, is there a Sloomoo design guide or Bible that they can steal and take into their own attraction? If not, you probably should write one, but, yeah.

Sara Schiller (41:17.378)
We probably should. So we've been lucky enough to partner with Method Design. And I kid you not, the first hand sketch that was made for Slimoo New York, our architect put a person in a wheelchair in it, hand drew it. And someone with that sensibility from without even going deep into what our mission is and who we're trying to be is a great partner to have. So we've had a great design partner.

We've had to sacrifice in certain areas, and I'll say the trade-offs can be difficult. To build something that's super accessible.

usually cost a lot of money. And so as entrepreneurs, okay, where are we going to take the money from? And I was lucky enough to work for Steve Heyer at Start With Hotels who taught me about branding. And one of his philosophies was, if it's not better, different or special, like don't invest in it. So if you come into our spaces and I'm probably going to be mad because I'm now telling the world about this, but you look at our ceilings and our lights, they are not

unbelievable. They're pretty basic lighting. Our floors, polished concrete floors, not the nicest floors. We haven't invested in a lot of things I think traditional retailers invest in. If it's not like guest facing, touching the guest and something memorable, we pretty much don't invest in it. It's allowed us, I think, to invest in the things in the right way so that people can access them.

John Pendergrast (42:58.473)
That makes sense. I mean, you figure out what are the things that are important to you, right? You figure out the things that are like, these are the things that are really important and these other things we can do less with, with those and spending in those areas, right? You you the balance of those things.

Sara Schiller (43:12.142)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (43:15.732)
Yeah, I think we all don't have Disney Universal money, right? You know, so how do you get the most bang for the buck on the guest experience and make it the most successful, which I think you guys have been really, really successful with. But...

Sara Schiller (43:29.964)
Well, and the design, the design is married with our staff, right? Like I always say, the, the slime is the star. So people come because of the slime or their kids want the slime. They don't even know they want it yet, but the people are who makes the memories. It's our staff. And I always say to our staff, I've never gotten an email that says, you know, the red Froot Loops slime, you know, fifth that in was the best slime ever.

But do I get the email saying, Audrey was incredible. She really smiled and taught us how to make bubbles? Yeah.

John Pendergrast (44:09.749)
So how do you advertise to, don't know. So my introduction to slime would have happened on YTV. Like on YTV we had.

I don't know, maybe this is a Canadian thing, but we had a show called, yeah, show called, yeah, it's probably a Canadian thing. So there was this show, and on this show, if anyone said these words, I don't remember what they are at the moment, it would immediately get dropped green slime on you from above the lights, and it would just crash into you, and they would have guests on, and they had some pretty big guests, and inevitably it was a word that people would use, accidentally. And all of a sudden they would get slimed.

Tim Samson (44:21.864)
It's a Canadian thing. I was just going to ask.

Sara Schiller (44:25.986)
haha

Sara Schiller (44:36.12)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (44:36.863)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (44:50.199)
introduction to slime and so when I think of that as a you know I'm a Gen Xer when I think of that and I'm like oh interesting like you're so far from that idea you're so far into a much more tactile that was just gross in many senses that idea what they called slime

Sara Schiller (45:05.186)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (45:07.581)
So it's just interesting, how do you advertise? How do you bring in people on slime? Because some people are going to be like, that's kind of messy or that's kind of gross. How do you get them across that line? Or do you not have to?

Sara Schiller (45:18.828)
Yeah. So John, one of our sayings is this is not the slime of your childhood. It's very different, very, very different. And we're in which many people in the world of attractions and experiences is in is we're only allowed to market to adults, right? But it's the kids that want to come. So how do you get that messaging across and that messaging through?

John Pendergrast (45:25.813)
Ha

Tim Samson (45:26.619)
No.

John Pendergrast (45:39.433)
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (45:46.122)
Yep.

Sara Schiller (45:46.626)
And we have a really cast a full approach for marketing that is not just online where Gen Xers are, which is Facebook, but you know, the Instagram and TikTok of the other kids. And we actually do CCTV, we have television ads, we do outdoor advertising, both in Billboard,

John Pendergrast (45:59.753)
Right?

Yeah, totally.

Sara Schiller (46:16.562)
as well as wild posting. do radio. Karen and I went on a sunshine tour through the Midwest in the middle of winter in yellow snowsuits, bringing slime everywhere to get people in Detroit and Grand Rapids to say, to Chicago, have a great weekend, have fun. we...

We believe that if we can get someone in, they'll also come back because everyone who comes leaves with a slime. Like when you buy a ticket, you get to custom make your own slime. So they're going home with a piece of slumoo that probably their kids will take. And then they're like, well, I want to go get more. I've got to get more.

Tim Samson (47:05.898)
a really interesting transition that they leave with slime because your model is slightly different than most immersive experiences. You have an 80-20 split and there's an old saying and I don't know how old it is but there's an old saying in the space of exit through the gift shop. So like all these attractions do it but but Slua is really built around the retail component with your split.

Sara Schiller (47:30.144)
Yeah, so this is probably not the smartest business move to create a business where you give someone the product. I think we did not wake up to this until like a year later when we were like, do people really need to buy another slime when they're custom making their own slime as part of the experience? So ironically, slime is the number one bestseller in our retail store. So.

John Pendergrast (47:49.802)
Right.

Sara Schiller (47:57.142)
people are still buying Slime and I think part of it is that the variations are endless and they're super cute. Like there's lots of different ones with clay pieces that are fun to push in. And then we have a large merchandise piece that's all around our IP and our characters. So it is the experience and we'd like to believe that people will come back and test that out. So.

The store is secondary. It is secondary, yeah. But you do exit through the gift shop. So we are trying to tap in.

Tim Samson (48:35.665)
Yeah, but it does transfer that experience to home. Right? They can relive it when they get home.

John Pendergrast (48:38.557)
It does.

Sara Schiller (48:38.658)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (48:42.71)
Yeah, and our charms that are in the slime that you make have a QR code on the back that then tie back into the characters and our digital reality. So we are trying to create a 360 world where, yeah, you might go online, but then you'll come back to us.

John Pendergrast (49:03.797)
Okay, so I've got a comment on you guys dressing up in sun suits essentially to walk around in the winter in the Midwest. So I'm Canadian, I have a, yes, sorry, snow suits, yeah. So I'm a Canadian, so I have a deep relationship with snow. But that idea is so hilarious. And I mean, this is proof of how not normal entrepreneurs are. Like who thinks of doing that kind of stuff? Entrepreneurs.

Sara Schiller (49:12.522)
Snow suits, snow suits, snow suits.

John Pendergrast (49:30.357)
So I often look around and look at other team members and go, not everyone's gonna be an entrepreneur. But that level of passion that you bring and entrepreneurs bring to things, I think everybody should have that.

How do you help the people that you're bringing up with you and that I know you're mentoring people just by doing what you're doing, you're mentoring staff and team members and people around you. How are you bringing people into that mindset? Because I can only imagine that you're a pretty contagious person that way.

Sara Schiller (50:03.06)
So we definitely make an impact. You can see I'm wearing hot pink right here today for our interview. Karen and I were very, very honored recently to win an Entrepreneur of the Year award from Ernst & Young, which is a big award. And when we went in, we were dressed up. We happened to have like slumu letter jackets.

John Pendergrast (50:10.931)
Yeah, it's awesome.

John Pendergrast (50:23.849)
That's huge. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (50:32.948)
Hahaha

Sara Schiller (50:33.937)
And I kid you not, but everyone that worked at Ernst & Young was running up to us saying, you must be the Slimu Girls. You must be the Slimu Girls, right? And so immediately everyone knows us and are coming up to our table and talking to us. We had the same thing happen at Chase recently. We went to an event at Chase and we were dressed up and we have bags of slime with us too. That doesn't hurt because we're passing out goodies, but

everyone's coming up to us. And I think our staff is learning by seeing, seeing that we're the only table in the room with everyone flocking. We're the ones where the head of, you know, payments for Chase is coming up and saying, I research you guys, I know you, and that leaves an impression on people. And when you're really...

John Pendergrast (51:06.805)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (51:23.473)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (51:29.678)
excited about what you're doing. I don't see how you could work here and not be passionate about it. But I want to say for me, it actually translates a little bit back to my older daughter because I used to always say to my younger daughter, let your freak flag fly because...

John Pendergrast (51:35.731)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

Sara Schiller (51:52.872)
we'd be walking down the street and my older daughter might be moaning or screaming or laughing hysterically and we might be in a store and she just, she can't stop laughing. She's crying, she's laughing so hard. And you know, at some point it was like, either we're, either we're gonna not go out ever or we're gonna go out and just be like, yeah, this is how we roll. We're laughing and screaming and having fun. And I think you lose that inhibition if you have someone in your life who's different.

and it's definitely part of our family's DNA.

John Pendergrast (52:27.069)
incredible way of seeing things. Here I am, I'm wearing the banker suit, essentially the light blue shirt and everything. But I love that, that whole mentality. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's him, always rocks it. It's just his thing. That's really interesting.

Sara Schiller (52:33.27)
Yes.

But Tim dressed for SLU Mood today. He's rocking it.

Tim Samson (52:40.592)
Hahaha!

John Pendergrast (52:48.125)
You've made an interesting statement kind of publicly that you believe that immersive experiences are the future of retail. That's kind of a profound statement, especially given that more and more people are buying online and you have the advent of a lot of malls closing, a lot of boarded up buildings in the space. Tell me a little bit about your thoughts there.

Sara Schiller (53:15.522)
Yeah, I think immersive means something really specific. Because I think people hear that and they think a room with projectors. for us, immersive is your senses, it's tactile, it's emotional, and it's a connection. think we have like my now she's 13, but my six year old.

John Pendergrast (53:24.873)
Yeah, yes, yes.

Tim Samson (53:27.119)
Ha

Sara Schiller (53:43.178)
will basically grow up only knowing immersive experiences, right? Because if she needs socks, she's never gonna go to T.J. Maxx or a Walmart, right? Like for that kind of stuff. But if she wants something that's more specific, she actually wants to engage in the product and the brand. you know.

Tim Samson (53:47.749)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (54:04.032)
On a very simple level, that's why Sephora is so effective, right? You go in, you can try things. There's people to help you experiment. And it is somewhat immersive. I don't think brands right now, big brands who are trying to create immersiveness.

by being just digital and doing screens are missing the point of a guest or a customer experience. And it's only when they take off their hat that they're trying to sell something and they turn it into, this is the core DNA of our brand that we want to deliver. And then, by the way, how do we sell it, right?

are that are things really going to evolve? So it's a really a branding question. What is at the core of your brand and how are you gonna get people to feel that? And the kids, young kids today will only wanna feel, they're gonna want that emotion, because they can get everything else. They can buy it online or they can just watch it online.

John Pendergrast (55:06.485)
Yeah, it's interesting. We've, like, we're on a call here, right? We're on a call where we're all digitally connected to each other.

And yet, and we're having a good talk, and yet if we were to sit in a room together, we would connect better. And I love brain science. I'm fascinated by how our minds work and the ways that they work. And they don't know how to describe it yet, but we have some sort of like brain wifi that connects us when we're in a room together that you don't get digitally, and they can't replicate digitally. And it's something to do with being in person with each other.

Sara Schiller (55:34.51)
Mmm.

Tim Samson (55:39.022)
Hmm.

John Pendergrast (55:43.925)
And I think it's sort of a fascinating environment that we, what you're saying is, you know, we need to connect with people and connect with the brand. And when we say connecting with the brand, I think we're connecting with the people that are the ambassadors of the brand, because that is what the brand really is. It is a, it is more than just a nice pretty picture or a logo and a thought process. It's where's that ethos coming from?

Sara Schiller (56:12.59)
What I love about what you're saying, because it taps into some research that was done by the National Institute for Play. don't know if you know. Yeah, so their 92 year old founder discovered that play is the second most important thing to your health after sleep.

John Pendergrast (56:21.533)
Mm-hmm. I've heard of this Institute before. Yes. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (56:39.017)
Really?

Sara Schiller (56:39.278)
and the absence of play can lead to severe

social consequences. Like you actually need play to be human, to be a good human, to connect and be out there. So there is something about playing that makes your brain go to the place. The same thing as having a good night's sleep, right? You need to play. And I believe that especially for slime, it's connecting you to yourself because you're triggering things in your hand and the scent that

John Pendergrast (56:47.733)
soon.

John Pendergrast (57:03.508)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (57:13.838)
you know, make your brain feel good, but then looking and smiling at other people and sharing it together and that smile and that connection. So you're firing on like three different levels when you come to Slimoo Institute because you're playing, you're connecting to yourself and you're connecting to others. And that's why I think people feel so good when they've left.

John Pendergrast (57:19.145)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shared experiences. Yeah.

Tim Samson (57:20.237)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (57:30.591)
Yeah.

John Pendergrast (57:37.865)
So I agree with you, and I think we're way off topic here, but this is a fascinating part of the conversation, so let's keep going. They did this study about interconnectivity between people and whether you could get that brain Wi-Fi connect going. And they only found one other place that they were able to do it digitally. And it's fascinating. It is in extremely immersive and cooperative video games.

Tim Samson (57:41.453)
Ha

Sara Schiller (58:00.75)
Mmm.

John Pendergrast (58:01.429)
where you are working, like maybe it's like a World of Warcraft or some game where you're on a group together, you believe the same, you're achieving the same goal together, it takes effort, there's ups and downs, there's these kind of things, you have these communities that get built. And then in that, they've been able to replicate that same kind of belonging or capability. And they don't know why. Yeah, yeah.

Sara Schiller (58:24.398)
That community piece, yeah. That community piece is critical. We did a study with GoodQuest where they were looking at loneliness for adults. And one of their philosophies is that people aren't necessarily more lonely than they were in the past, but we have a whole language to talk about loneliness now, right? We have the words and the dialogue to talk about it. And so they measured people's loneliness and happiness and connectedness before.

John Pendergrast (58:43.925)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (58:53.366)
And after they were sent slime to their office and putting slime in the conference room meant that people would pick it up, start playing. What color did you choose? What scent did you choose? And they were starting to get to know their colleagues in a way that was fun and playful, not just where's my spreadsheet or why are you losing money? That for the first five minutes of a meeting allowed people to be connected. And at the end they were like,

the percentage of people who felt connected to their business, connected to each other, less lonely, went way up just from having a little bit of slime in their meeting rooms.

John Pendergrast (59:36.085)
You're have to order a bunch of slime, Tim. That's what we're have to do.

Tim Samson (59:38.432)
I was thinking the same thing,

Sara Schiller (59:40.494)
When we first started, and one of the things when you know you're onto something, we had a meeting and the meetings would go on and on and Karen and I were we're entrepreneurs, we gotta get going. And in the end of one of these meetings, this woman goes, this is the best meeting I've had all year. I've never had a meeting that's so good because we've been sitting here playing with slime and I'm like, no wonder the meeting lasted an hour and a half. Everyone was just having fun.

John Pendergrast (01:00:03.571)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:00:04.715)
Ha

John Pendergrast (01:00:07.381)
Okay, we're getting close to the end of our podcast here, which I'm sad because this has been absolutely fantastic. We're gonna go to something we call the lightning round. We're gonna ask you quick questions and see if you can answer quickly.

Sara Schiller (01:00:19.981)
boy.

Tim Samson (01:00:20.897)
Ha ha ha.

John Pendergrast (01:00:22.165)
We've never done the lightning round before so this may be one of those trial and error things that we find out doesn't really work but let's go for it. So and the irony of the lightning round is that the very first question is super long which is kind of funny. so I'm gonna read the question out and then you're gonna laugh because it's really long. It says looking at the competitive landscape, Meow Wolf's dense narratives, Camp's licensed IP, you've forged a third path. For operators who want to build original brands but don't

Sara Schiller (01:00:29.207)
All right.

Sara Schiller (01:00:34.286)
Okay.

Tim Samson (01:00:34.974)
Ha

John Pendergrast (01:00:52.22)
have a sci-fi universe or Disney movie to start with. What's your advice?

Sara Schiller (01:01:00.28)
happened to something that is meaningful and that you're love and you're passionate about.

John Pendergrast (01:01:07.273)
Wow, you just nailed that answer. That was perfect. Lightning Road answer, check mark.

Sara Schiller (01:01:11.278)
Is the, the, is the, wait a minute, okay. Is the lightning round like a short answer or is it, did you want like longer answers? Cause to me lightning round is like,

Tim Samson (01:01:12.29)
The ques-

John Pendergrast (01:01:20.521)
No, you did perfect. I...

Tim Samson (01:01:25.035)
Well, yeah. Yeah, we only have three questions in the lightning round. So.

Sara Schiller (01:01:25.656)
Quit.

Sara Schiller (01:01:29.998)
Oh, good. I can, I can, we can alternate and I can ask, I can ask you guys, you guys a question. All right. So my, my question that I have, cause you, you're, you're looking across, uh, you know, a whole industry is, um, how do you think the world and I'm to use specifically of family attractions, family entertainment is evolving.

Tim Samson (01:01:35.539)
yeah, we could do that too. Yeah. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:01:36.649)
Yeah, totally. Go for it. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:01:47.498)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:02:00.009)
Good question. Tim, you want to go first? I'm happy to jump in.

Tim Samson (01:02:05.283)
yeah, it's, it's, it's been, it's been interesting because the, have successfully gotten people to put their phones down, but the attractions industry in general have been fighting phones for a number of years. can't take it on this. You can't take it on a ride. You can't take it in this experience. We don't want you to take videos. We don't want you to share. It really goes against everything that you have built around Sloomoo

Right? What the attractions industry is doing. And I think that we're starting to shift in, in a way we see Disney building rides, like the Tron light life's light cycle ride that actually has a compartment in front of you to put your phone in. Right? So you take it on the ride with you, which is something that was really unheard of. but I think that we're shifting the. Back to the, back to the guest.

Right? Like we've tried to fit the guest in this cookie cutter and now it's more of a, what does the guest need to feel connected and disconnected at the same time within the experience to really accelerate that. So I think that we're seeing that more and more. And I think the adoption of smart technology, like I think Disney went too far with, with some of the stuff that they've done in the park, because you can't really experience it without looking at your phone the whole time.

Sara Schiller (01:03:17.486)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (01:03:32.598)
But I think the industry is moving, especially family-based attractions, to the adoption of smart technology.

Sara Schiller (01:03:41.258)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

John Pendergrast (01:03:44.309)
So that's a fantastic answer. Also, you completely failed the lightning round, because that was like a long answer and it spoke. no. So I'll try and answer the question as well. And that is that I think the definition of family continues to change. And I think some of the more traditional

Tim Samson (01:03:52.406)
Have I ever given you have I ever given a short answer in my life? No

John Pendergrast (01:04:12.117)
parks out there are continually trying to figure out what that means. We still think in the idea of twos and fours, like two adults, two kids. I think that continues to change. And then I think that the absolute purpose of any attraction.

Sara Schiller (01:04:18.765)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:04:28.349)
is to separate you from reality and give you a belonging in a different reality that you can share with the people around you. Now that doesn't mean necessarily always your family, although that would be optimal because those are the people you're spend the large portion of your life with, but give you a memory or something else that is just going to be something that you can share with someone else and that's unique to you. And I think that's really hard to do at scale.

but I don't think it's impossible. hi, all.

Sara Schiller (01:05:02.656)
I agree. mean, I'm finding and Karen and I have found sources of information through performance art. And I think that's what continues to tap our spirit and our inspiration is going in and seeing artwork where an artist

has gone out on the edge and is doing something not scalable, but totally unbelievable and trying to be provocative and get you to think differently, see differently, feel differently. And we're always going to try to experience things and bring little nuggets of that back with us.

John Pendergrast (01:05:29.705)
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:05:46.542)
We just went to an immersive experience in New York City called Viola's Room where you took off your socks, no phone, no anything else by the way, Tim. And you had to crawl through tunnels and you had a headset that triggered music and you followed light through a maze. And it was good. It wasn't perfect, but it gave us little ideas, right? Because it was a super cool, interesting way to tell a story. And that's where I think...

John Pendergrast (01:05:55.039)
Yep.

Tim Samson (01:05:59.381)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:06:13.718)
the lot of the digital components miss is the storytelling. Because that's what families want is to have their own story that's wrapped inside a story that you've been able to create around them. if something's really digital, sometimes it's missing that.

John Pendergrast (01:06:29.653)
I agree. So I like to tell stories. So I'm going to tell a very brief story and then they can cut it out later. But basically one of my most profound experiences that I ever had with an attraction, I think I was 11. And we had a place near my, I grew up in Thunder Bay, Ontario in Canada. And we had something there, an attraction called Old Fort William, which was a historical old like...

fort that was a British fort up in the middle of the woods protecting the river where they would bring all the materials up and down the river.

And I went there and I spent the day as a day camp. Now remember not wanting to go, but I went as a day camp. There was about 20 kids that went. And they spent the day teaching us the history of this camp and how it would have operated. And they had live actors in all the roles. So there was a guy making canoes, there was a guy making, like there was a blacksmith, they were making bread, these other kind of things.

Sara Schiller (01:07:20.526)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:07:28.519)
And some point at the end of the day, they said, we're gonna do something. We're gonna pick six of you. And somehow I was one of the ones picked. And they said, go in that room and change into those clothes that you have in the room in the corners and the numbers we give you. And I got a gentleman's outfit. And so I put on the beaver skin hat or beaver hat and the suit jacket and stuff like that. And I walked around and all of the people in the park,

treated me as if I was actually a gentleman of that time. And we got bread, we walked through some of the back parts of the place you couldn't see before. It was just so profoundly magical that there was not a digital thing in sight.

Sara Schiller (01:08:12.214)
Mm-hmm.

Tim Samson (01:08:12.679)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:08:13.353)
but I got to be something and pretend to be something and be in a different world for a little bit of time. And they curated the whole thing, but I walked around and I'm like, I want to go in that building. They're like, okay, you know, let you do that. And something about that just got in my head that that's what we're trying to do. We're trying, so simple.

Sara Schiller (01:08:28.258)
And it's so simple. It's so simple. That's what I love about it. It's analog. It's storytelling. You got to transform yourself. You got to go to a different place. You were part of a story. I mean, it's awesome.

Tim Samson (01:08:30.963)
Mm-hmm.

John Pendergrast (01:08:33.428)
Yep.

John Pendergrast (01:08:40.681)
Yep, and I remember it vividly and now I'm 50, right? So like these things just stay with you and I think we're trying to do that in a lot of different places. So, okay.

Tim Samson (01:08:54.291)
It's really these curated experiences that are one off. We're experts at building for the masses and I think the industry is shifting to creating these magical moments right within that space. And you can do it without spending a lot of money.

John Pendergrast (01:08:56.885)
100%.

John Pendergrast (01:09:09.801)
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, agreed, yeah. So why don't we transition here? We're gonna do the beginning again because we never introduced you and our producer immediately texted us and said, great job. Also, could you do the first part? Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:09:23.411)
Ha

Sara Schiller (01:09:28.705)
I was wondering if maybe you guys did the introduction pre-conversation.

Tim Samson (01:09:29.441)
Hahahaha!

Tim Samson (01:09:35.035)
No, no, we just forgot.

John Pendergrast (01:09:35.837)
No, no, we're just, we're just, we're just amateurs. You know, we're learning these things. yeah. by the way, it's, it's a bit of a theme I have going. I'll step into a meeting and I'll be like, okay, let's get started because that's just how my mindset works. And I constantly have my senior leaders going before we do that, let's introduce everybody. And I'm like, yeah, that bright. So, you know, it's, it's, something that it's a me thing. So, I think what we do here is, I'll do the introduction here.

Sara Schiller (01:09:38.286)
It won't happen again.

Tim Samson (01:09:49.138)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:09:50.765)
Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:09:55.346)
Ha!

John Pendergrast (01:10:05.317)
Sarah and then I'll probably read some of this and then we can probably do a couple of extra little outtakes here just to get ourselves something that we were happy with. So I'll start off here.

Today we're joined by Sarah Schiller, co-founder and co-CEO of Sloomoo Institute. But Sarah's story actually starts long before Slime became a $30 million business. She's what I call a space alchemist, someone who has this rare ability to take our unconventional concepts and turn them into experiences that people literally can't stop talking about.

Before SLU MUTE, Sarah revolutionized corporate meetings through her company, MEET, where she created art-filled venues in downtown New York that were so compelling, global brands like Chanel, Lego, and others chose her spaces over their own corporate boardrooms. She also co-founded the Wooster Collective, which became the world's largest street art blog, and transformed an entire building into a temporary street art gallery that became a must-see destination.

But here's what makes Sarah's perspective so valuable for attraction operators. She built her career on taking things that shouldn't work as attractions. Corporate meetings, for instance, street art, and yes, slime, and turning them into experiences that people seek out and pay premium prices for. Sloomoo Institute now welcomes over 500,000 visitors annually across five locations, with 75 % of their customers finding them through organic social media.

That's the kind of word of mouth marketing that every attraction dreams of. Sarah, welcome to Signal. Let's dive into how you've mastered the art of turning the unexpected into the unforgettable.

Sara Schiller (01:11:50.072)
Thank you, happy to be here.

Tim Samson (01:11:54.61)
we're in trouble. We're getting in trouble.

Sara Schiller (01:11:56.238)
Here it comes!

John Pendergrast (01:11:58.421)
I'm getting called out.

Sara Schiller (01:12:14.06)
You were doing a lot of...

Those sentences were very well crafted, very well crafted sentences.

John Pendergrast (01:12:25.237)
You can thank Gerry for that.

Alright Tim, you're crack. You get to do it.

Tim Samson (01:12:32.922)
I'm gonna totally tongue tie this, but we can try it. We can try this!

John Pendergrast (01:12:34.325)
Hahaha!

Tim Samson (01:12:42.648)
Yeah, well...

John Pendergrast (01:12:42.695)
Actually, before we do this, you've said thank you and welcome here. We could do this in post, Gerry, so we're not taking more of Sarah's time. We could absolutely do this in post. I had a brief film career.

Tim Samson (01:12:54.022)
Yeah. Yeah.

Sara Schiller (01:12:58.062)
But if you had done the introduction, it ties into a lot of the things that I talked about, like selling a business, my street art. So it will pull the breadcrumbs together, which is gonna be kinda cool. One thing I did wanna say or tell you guys, because I think it is also a unique part of my story, is not only do I...

John Pendergrast (01:13:03.828)
Right?

Tim Samson (01:13:05.808)
Yeah. Yeah.

John Pendergrast (01:13:06.525)
Yeah, absolutely.

Tim Samson (01:13:11.091)
Ha

Sara Schiller (01:13:26.956)
like love the art and the guest experience piece. But I also have my MBA in finance. So I have the other side of the brain fully ticking. And one of my landmark projects that I did at Starwood Hotels was I built a financial model with a team to calculate return on invested capital by name of customer, which only like five companies in the world have ever done. It's a big effort.

John Pendergrast (01:13:36.477)
You do.

Sara Schiller (01:13:56.59)
That ability, think as an entrepreneur to go across all of your operational part components was really critical in helping us get through the pandemic and get off the ground and do something that's never been done before where there is no financial model.

John Pendergrast (01:14:03.796)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (01:14:17.41)
that Karen and I say that we have a Venn diagram of skills and in the middle is building a brand and knowing exactly what a branded experience feels like. And then she and I divide and conquer everything else. She's on that marketing side and storytelling side and I have a lot of the business part of it.

John Pendergrast (01:14:42.549)
That is once again just underlining the fact that entrepreneurs aren't always normal people. They have a lot of skills and a lot of things across a wide category. And you sound like you've found a partner that just really, really suits.

Sara Schiller (01:14:49.74)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:14:53.837)
Yeah.

Sara Schiller (01:14:58.146)
We suit each other well and I can't tell you how many times we've walked into meetings and we'll have our VP of ops with us and he's hanging out and the person in the meeting will turn to him and start asking him questions and Karen and I are sitting there going like, we can raise money, we can build a business, like don't just assume.

John Pendergrast (01:15:18.997)
Yeah.

Yeah, I always try and describe my job description. put that together, I'm like, well, taking out the garbage and fundraising and everything in between, right? Like that's just the job description.

Sara Schiller (01:15:34.318)
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Tim Samson (01:15:38.288)
I do have one last question for you, Sarah. So you and Karen, I feel weird asking this, but you and Karen are both serial entrepreneurs at heart and Sloomoo's not done. It's just getting started, but what's next?

Sara Schiller (01:15:56.59)
So we may be crazy, but we want to start another business together. So we're in this together. I think we would like to really revolutionize something in the arts. If we made a ton of money and didn't have to work, it would be doing something around the arts and performance art, performative, immersive.

John Pendergrast (01:16:01.438)
You

Tim Samson (01:16:10.448)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:16:19.318)
art experiences and enabling those to come to life. I think that's what creates like to John's story about dressing up is it really can impact kids and change how they view the world as well as adults. So I think that's something that we'd want to do is to tap into all of our artists' friends.

Tim Samson (01:16:43.705)
Well, we'll be there when it opens.

John Pendergrast (01:16:46.099)
Yep, absolutely.

Sara Schiller (01:16:47.854)
I love that. I love that.

John Pendergrast (01:16:50.931)
Well, thank you so very much for taking the time with us today. It's been fantastic. I hope our paths cross again. I'd love to come and see one of your attractions. It sounds like a really good time.

Sara Schiller (01:17:03.168)
You definitely have to come and we'll send you boxes of slime. can't believe our PR company. We've been told not to slime during being video recorded because it's so distracting for the people interviewing us that they can't remember their questions or whatever.

John Pendergrast (01:17:07.898)
Yeah, please do.

John Pendergrast (01:17:19.954)
Yeah, well, it's like my office is like this too. I don't have any slime. I actually should get some slime because I have all these like little fidget toys that I'm like constantly playing with in some way, or form. Slime would be great.

Tim Samson (01:17:26.991)
Mm-hmm.

Sara Schiller (01:17:29.164)
Yeah, Gerry, send me everyone's addresses and we'll get boxes out to you guys.

John Pendergrast (01:17:33.058)
That would be fantastic.

Sara Schiller (01:17:55.296)
Awesome. Nice talking to you guys. Bye bye.

Tim Samson (01:17:56.847)
Alright, thank you so much.

John Pendergrast (01:17:56.969)
you as well. Thank you. Bye.
