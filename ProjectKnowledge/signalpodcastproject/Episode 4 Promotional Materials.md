## **Subject:** The pricing mistake costing you direct bookings‚ÄîSignal Ep. 4

**Preview text:** Evan Reece on why pricing hygiene matters more than your algorithm.

**Copy:**

Here's a question most attraction operators never ask:

**Are you accidentally training your guests to buy somewhere other than your website?**

In **Episode 4 of Signal**, John Pendergrast and Tim Samson sit down with **Evan Reece**‚Äîformer CEO of Liftopia/Catalate and the person who pioneered dynamic pricing for ski resorts and attractions worldwide.

Evan has overseen more than $1.2 billion in bookings powered by pricing science. And his first piece of advice to a new client?

**Stop your dynamic pricing.**

Not forever. But long enough to fix what he calls "pricing hygiene"‚Äîthe unsexy work of making sure every sales channel isn't undermining your direct bookings.

One attraction did this and shifted from 45% to 55% direct bookings almost immediately.

**This episode isn't about buying more software. It's about understanding your guests' behavior:**

- Why price consistency across channels matters more than having the "perfect" price
- How to shift buying patterns toward advance purchase without destroying trust
- Why consumer confidence beats conversion rates as a success metric
- The psychology behind discounting (and when it backfires)
- What hotel revenue managers know about "intent" that attractions don't track
- How AI agents might change pricing forever‚Äîand what to do now

Evan has spent two decades studying how people make purchasing decisions under uncertainty. This conversation reveals what actually drives revenue‚Äîand it's not what most operators think.

If you're planning your 2026 pricing strategy right now, this episode will challenge assumptions you didn't know you were making.

Evan Reece spent eight minutes Googling a potential client's attraction.

He found lower prices on the first five websites he checked.

That client had invested heavily in dynamic pricing technology. They had smart people. They had a world-class attraction in a major city.

But they were undermining themselves across 150+ sales channels.
