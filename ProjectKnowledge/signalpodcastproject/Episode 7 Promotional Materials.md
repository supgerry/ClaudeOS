# **Episode 07: Activating Guest Data with the RFM Framework for Attractions with TJ Christensen, CEO & Founding Partner of BlueGator**

If McDonald's can turn a $3 coffee customer into a breakfast regular, why can't you turn your "stroller brigade" into lunch customers?

In this episode of **Signal**, hosts [**John Pendergrast**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pendergrast-082820/) and [**Tim Samson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothysamson/) sit down with **TJ Christensen**, CEO and Founding Partner of [**BlueGator**](https://www.bluegator.com/), a Salesforce consulting firm helping zoos, museums, aquariums, and theme parks turn guest data into unforgettable experiences.

With over 20 years in attractions—including roles at Disney, Wyndham, and a decade leading product strategy at Accesso—TJ has seen firsthand why most attractions are drowning in data but starving for insights. His solution? Apply the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) framework—the same scoring methodology that powers loyalty programs at retail giants—to the unique challenges of zoos, museums, and theme parks.

From identifying high-frequency, low-spend members to building tech stacks that put operators in control, this conversation explores why your ticketing system isn't a CRM, how AI will change guest engagement, and what attractions can learn from an English Premier League membership box.

**You'll hear about:**

- The RFM framework explained: how McDonald's turns coffee buyers into breakfast regulars—and how attractions can do the same
- Why your ticketing system is not a CRM (and what to do about it)
- The "stroller brigade" strategy: turning high-frequency, low-spend members into lunch customers
- Why less than 10% of attractions are using data well—and what separates the leaders
- How to assess your tech stack: is it ready for the next five to ten years?
- The Edmonton Zoo's Twitch experiment that generated $60,000 in donations from a red panda
- Where AI fits: SDR agents, service chatbots, and content engines
- Why human connection still matters—and where technology should (and shouldn't) replace it

## **Subject:** The framework that turns guest data into action—Signal Ep. 7

**Preview text:** TJ Christensen on why your ticketing system isn't a CRM (and what to do about it).

**Copy:**

Here's a question most attraction operators never think to ask:

**If McDonald's can turn a $3 coffee customer into a breakfast regular, why can't you turn your "stroller brigade" into lunch customers?**

In **Episode 7 of Signal**, John Pendergrast and Tim Samson sit down with **TJ Christensen**—CEO of BlueGator and a 20-year attractions veteran with experience at Disney, Wyndham, and Accesso.

TJ has spent years helping zoos, museums, and theme parks turn their data chaos into actionable guest segments. His approach? Apply the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) framework—the same scoring methodology that powers loyalty programs at retail giants—to the unique challenges of attractions.

**This episode isn't about buying more software. It's about understanding your guests' behavior:**

- How RFM scoring works—and how to apply it to your members and daily ticket buyers
- Why your ticketing system is NOT a CRM (and why that distinction matters)
- The tech stack question every operator should ask: can this take us forward for the next 5-10 years?
- Why less than 10% of attractions are using data well—and what the leaders do differently
- How Edmonton Zoo generated $60,000 in donations from a red panda on Twitch
- Where AI actually fits: SDR agents for group sales, service chatbots, and content engines

TJ reveals what's actually possible when you stop treating data as something to collect and start treating it as something to activate.

If you're planning your tech strategy right now, this episode will challenge assumptions about what your current stack can actually do.

TJ Christensen asked a question that stopped me in my tracks:

"The consumers buying on Amazon are the same consumers buying at your zoo. Why would they expect less?"

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-7-tj-christensen-rfm-data-guest-engagement](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-7-tj-christensen-rfm-data-guest-engagement)

TJ has spent 20 years in attractions—including Disney, Wyndham, and a decade at Accesso—and now runs BlueGator, where he helps zoos, museums, and theme parks turn data chaos into actionable insights.

Here's what struck me most:

He estimates less than 10% of attractions are using their data well. Not because they don't have data—they're drowning in it. But because it's siloed, disconnected, and nobody's built the foundation to actually act on it.

His approach is deceptively simple: apply RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) scoring—the same framework that powers loyalty programs at retail giants. If McDonald's can turn a $3 coffee customer into a breakfast regular, why can't you turn your "stroller brigade"—those members who show up at 8am and leave by 10:30 without spending anything—into lunch customers?

We also got into why your ticketing system isn't a CRM (even if you think it is), where AI actually fits in guest engagement, and a wild story about Edmonton Zoo generating $60K in donations from a red panda on Twitch.

If you're thinking about your tech stack and wondering whether it can take you forward for the next 5-10 years—this conversation will help you answer that question.

**Copy:**

I've been talking about return visits for years. Every operator has.

But TJ Christensen reframed it in a way that clicked.

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-7-tj-christensen-rfm-data-guest-engagement](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-7-tj-christensen-rfm-data-guest-engagement)

TJ applies the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) framework—the same scoring methodology that powers loyalty programs at retail giants—to the unique challenges of attractions.

The example that stuck with me: the "stroller brigade."

You know them. Family memberships that show up when the gate opens at 8am, walk around with friends, and leave by 10:30 for lunch—without spending a dime. High recency, high frequency, low monetary.

TJ's question: what if you could get them to stay for lunch once a week? A surprise "kids eat free" offer targeted to that specific segment. Now the kids are begging to stay. You've just laddered up spend without discounting to everyone.

That's the power of actually using your data instead of just collecting it.

We also talked about:

✅ Why your ticketing system is not a CRM (this is a critical distinction)

✅ The tech stack question every operator should ask themselves

✅ How Edmonton Zoo made $60K from a red panda on Twitch

✅ Where AI fits—and where human connection still matters

TJ has seen this from every angle—Disney, Wyndham, Accesso, and now helping cultural institutions through BlueGator. If you're thinking about data strategy, this one's worth your time.
