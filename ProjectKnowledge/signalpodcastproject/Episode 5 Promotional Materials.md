# **Episode 05: Building Culture That Lasts by Design with Shaun McKeogh, CEO & Founder of Attractions Academy**

Every operator knows culture matters—but few know how to design one that survives when half the team turns over every season.

In this episode of **Signal**, hosts [John Pendergrast](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pendergrast-082820/) and [Tim Samson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothysamson/) sit down with **Shaun McKeogh, ICAE**, Founder and CEO of [Attractions Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/attractions-academy). With more than two decades leading organizational development and cultural transformation across 30-plus countries, Shaun has helped brands like **Ferrari World Abu Dhabi**, **Gardens by the Bay Singapore**, **Village Roadshow Theme Parks**, and the **Saudi Vision 2030 initiative** turn culture from a slogan into a system.

Shaun shares what most leaders overlook about culture, why investing in seasonal staff pays long-term dividends, and how simple, repeatable frameworks can make service excellence part of daily operations—not an afterthought.

**You’ll hear about:**

- Why most operators fail at culture (hint: they treat seasonal staff like they're "just temporary")
- How Ferrari World built world-class culture from scratch across 32 nationalities
- The difference between "great job today" and recognition that actually changes behavior
- Why employee engagement surveys are underutilized (and how to fix that)
- How to make seasonal workers fall in love with your company—even if they're only there for six weeks
- Why "hiring for attitude" isn't enough without strategic onboarding systems

## **Subject:** Your seasonal staff problem isn’t about money—Signal Ep. 5

_A/B test alt: "Ferrari World built world-class culture across 32 countries. Here's how."_

**Preview text:** Shaun McKeogh on why treating seasonal staff as "temporary" destroys culture.

Here's a hard truth about seasonal operations:

**If you treat employees like they're "only here for six months," they'll deliver service that feels temporary.**

In **Episode 5 of Signal**, we sit down with **Shaun McKeogh, ICAE**—founder of **Attractions Academy** and the person who built Ferrari World Abu Dhabi's award-winning culture from scratch across 32 nationalities.

Shaun has spent two decades helping premier attractions worldwide answer the question most operators avoid: How do you build lasting culture when half your team turns over every season?

His answer? Culture doesn't happen by accident. It happens by design.

**In this episode, you'll discover:**

- **The fatal mindset shift** — why "they're only here for six months" undermines everything you're trying to build
- **How to make employees fall in love with your company** — even if they're seasonal (and why brand ambassadors defend you when guests get angry)
- **The Warner Brothers bakery experiment** — how giving ownership of P&L transformed frontline performance
- **Ferrari World's suggestion box that actually worked** — paying employees back based on problem-solving value
- **Recognition that changes behavior** — why "great job today" doesn't work (and what does)
- **The one thing to do next week** — gather your team and ask one question that starts everything

This isn't about having a bigger budget than Disney. It's about being strategic with what you have.

Shaun proves that small seasonal operations can achieve the same cultural outcomes as global brands—just through different methods. And it starts with treating every employee—whether they're there for one week or two years—as true stakeholders in the business.

If you're planning for next season right now, this episode will challenge how you think about hiring, training, and building teams that guests actually notice.

Most attraction operators treat seasonal staff like they're "only here for six months."

That mindset destroys culture before it even starts.
