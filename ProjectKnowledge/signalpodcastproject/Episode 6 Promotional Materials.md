# **Episode 06: Getting Guests to Do One More Thing at Morey’s Piers with Tyler Jacobs**

What if loyalty wasn't about coupons—but about getting guests to do just one more thing?

In this episode of **Signal**, hosts **John Pendergrast** and **Tim Samson** sit down with **Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey’s Piers & Resorts**, to break down how one of America’s most beloved seaside destinations is modernizing guest engagement without losing its soul.

In just four months with a core team of three, Tyler and his colleagues launched **Morey’s FAM Club**—Morey's first-ever loyalty program. They integrated multiple systems, cleaned years of guest data, and rolled out a points-based program that delivers real-time offers within five minutes of a guest stepping off a ride.

What makes this story remarkable? Morey's has always been known for its no-discount philosophy. Loyalty at Morey's isn't about giving things away—it's about creating value, nudging behavior, and enhancing the guest experience.

**You’ll hear about:**

- Why Morey's talked about loyalty for two decades before finally launching—and what changed
- How competing with pizza stands "just feet away" across the boardwalk drove the need for loyalty
- The "make it dumb" philosophy that unlocked years of stalled innovation
- Why offers have to be valuable—and how "buy one chips, get one free" failed
- Building a guest 360 view without massive budgets or giant tech teams
- The edge case that almost broke the system—and how Tyler refused to admit defeat
- Why technology should enhance the experience, not replace it ("What is grandma going to do?")
- How five years of data infrastructure groundwork made a four-month launch possible

## **Subject:** How Morey’s Piers gets guests to do “one more thing” — Signal Ep. 6

**Preview text:** Tyler Jacobs on launching Morey’s FAM Club in 4 months without discounting.

Most attractions think loyalty means discounts.

Morey’s Piers proved otherwise.

In **Episode 06 of Signal**, John Pendergrast and Tim Samson sit down with **Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey’s Piers**, to break down how a three-person team launched **FAM Club**—Morey’s first-ever loyalty program—in just four months.

The catch? Morey's has always been known for its no-discount philosophy. So loyalty couldn't be about coupons. It had to be about getting guests to do **one more thing**—with Morey's instead of the competition.

**In this episode, you'll discover:**

- **Why "making it dumb" unlocked years of stalled progress** — the simplicity breakthrough that changed everything
- **The 50/50 surprise** — season pass holders vs. new visitors weren't split the way Tyler expected
- **Why offers must be valuable** — and how "buy one chips, get one free" became an internal cautionary tale
- **The edge case that almost broke everything** — and why hope isn't a plan
- **Building a guest 360 without massive budgets** — five years of groundwork that made four months possible
- **The grandma test** — why technology should enhance the experience, not replace it

If you're thinking about loyalty for your operation, this episode will challenge how you think about value, data infrastructure, and what guests actually want in exchange for their engagement.

**Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey's Piers**, joins **John Pendergrast** and **Tim Samson, ICAE** to share how Morey's FAM Club went from concept to launch—delivering real-time offers within five minutes of guests stepping off a ride.

The challenge? No gates. Guests can walk across the boardwalk to competitors anytime. So loyalty had to create real value—not just coupons.

**In this conversation:**

✅ How five years of data infrastructure made a four-month launch possible 
✅ The 50/50 surprise—season pass holders vs. new visitors 
✅ Why offers must be valuable (and the "buy one chips" cautionary tale) 
✅ The "grandma test"—why technology should enhance, not replace the experience 
✅ How small teams can build enterprise-level results with clear constraints

For operators thinking about loyalty, this is a practical playbook from a team that shipped it with limited resources.
