# **Episode 06: Getting Guests to Do One More Thing at Morey’s Piers with Tyler Jacobs**

What if loyalty wasn't about coupons—but about getting guests to do just one more thing?

In this episode of **Signal**, hosts **John Pendergrast** and **Tim Samson** sit down with **Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey’s Piers & Resorts**, to break down how one of America’s most beloved seaside destinations is modernizing guest engagement without losing its soul.

In just four months with a core team of three, Tyler and his colleagues launched **Morey’s FAM Club**—Morey's first-ever loyalty program. They integrated multiple systems, cleaned years of guest data, and rolled out a points-based program that delivers real-time offers within five minutes of a guest stepping off a ride.

What makes this story remarkable? Morey's has always been known for its no-discount philosophy. Loyalty at Morey's isn't about giving things away—it's about creating value, nudging behavior, and enhancing the guest experience.

**You’ll hear about:**

- Why Morey's talked about loyalty for two decades before finally launching—and what changed
- How competing with pizza stands "just feet away" across the boardwalk drove the need for loyalty
- The "make it dumb" philosophy that unlocked years of stalled innovation
- Why offers have to be valuable—and how "buy one chips, get one free" failed
- Building a guest 360 view without massive budgets or giant tech teams
- The edge case that almost broke the system—and how Tyler refused to admit defeat
- Why technology should enhance the experience, not replace it ("What is grandma going to do?")
- How five years of data infrastructure groundwork made a four-month launch possible

## **Subject:** How Morey’s Piers gets guests to do “one more thing” — Signal Ep. 6

**Preview text:** Tyler Jacobs on launching Morey’s FAM Club in 4 months without discounting.

Most attractions think loyalty means discounts.

Morey’s Piers proved otherwise.

In **Episode 06 of Signal**, John Pendergrast and Tim Samson sit down with **Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey’s Piers**, to break down how a three-person team launched **FAM Club**—Morey’s first-ever loyalty program—in just four months.

The catch? Morey's has always been known for its no-discount philosophy. So loyalty couldn't be about coupons. It had to be about getting guests to do **one more thing**—with Morey's instead of the competition.

**In this episode, you'll discover:**

- **Why "making it dumb" unlocked years of stalled progress** — the simplicity breakthrough that changed everything
- **The 50/50 surprise** — season pass holders vs. new visitors weren't split the way Tyler expected
- **Why offers must be valuable** — and how "buy one chips, get one free" became an internal cautionary tale
- **The edge case that almost broke everything** — and why hope isn't a plan
- **Building a guest 360 without massive budgets** — five years of groundwork that made four months possible
- **The grandma test** — why technology should enhance the experience, not replace it

If you're thinking about loyalty for your operation, this episode will challenge how you think about value, data infrastructure, and what guests actually want in exchange for their engagement.

Most attractions think loyalty means discounts.

Morey’s Piers proved otherwise.

🎙 **New episode of Signal is live** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers)

**Tyler Jacobs**, Director of Guest Engagement & Analytics at **Morey's Piers**, joins **John Pendergrast** and **Tim Samson, ICAE** to share how Morey's FAM Club went from concept to launch—delivering real-time offers within five minutes of guests stepping off a ride.

The challenge? No gates. Guests can walk across the boardwalk to competitors anytime. So loyalty had to create real value—not just coupons.

**In this conversation:**

✅ How five years of data infrastructure made a four-month launch possible 
✅ The 50/50 surprise—season pass holders vs. new visitors 
✅ Why offers must be valuable (and the "buy one chips" cautionary tale) 
✅ The "grandma test"—why technology should enhance, not replace the experience 
✅ How small teams can build enterprise-level results with clear constraints

For operators thinking about loyalty, this is a practical playbook from a team that shipped it with limited resources.

Tim and Tyler Jacobs talk almost every day.

So when we sat down to record this episode of Signal, I already knew this wasn't going to be a normal interview. These two have a shorthand that comes from years of sitting side by side - literally keeping a whiteboard of "Tyler sayings" to track how often "can't be that hard" turned out to be very, very hard.

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers)

Here's what I took away from the conversation:

Morey's FAM Club isn't a discount program. It's built around a simple question: how do we get guests to do one more thing with us?

That might sound obvious until you understand the context. Morey's operates on a boardwalk with no gates. There's pizza stands and t-shirt shops literally feet away. Guests can walk across to a competitor anytime. So loyalty can't just be coupons - it has to create actual value.

Tyler and his team launched this in four months with a core group of three. Real-time offers hitting guests' phones within five minutes of stepping off a ride. And the whole thing runs on years of foundational data infrastructure they'd been quietly building.

What I found most interesting was the philosophy behind the offers themselves: they have to be valuable. Not just "buy one chips, get a second free" - that was apparently an old cautionary tale Tim still gets blamed for. Actually valuable offers.

If you're an operator thinking about loyalty and wondering whether you need a massive budget or a giant tech team to pull it off - this conversation might change your perspective.

Tyler Jacobs and I talk almost every day.

So when he joined John and me on Signal to break down how Morey's FAM Club came together, it wasn't a formal interview—it was the kind of conversation we'd have anyway, just with microphones on.

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-6-tyler-jacobs-loyalty-program-moreys-piers)

Here's what makes this story worth your time:

Tyler and a core team of three launched FAM Club in four months—integrating systems, cleaning years of guest data, and delivering real-time offers within five minutes of a guest stepping off a ride.

(Tyler will protest this framing—he's quick to point out that a ton of people across Morey's made this happen. But someone had to drive it, and that was him and his team.)

And here's what I love about how Morey's approaches loyalty: it's not about discounts. It never has been. It's about getting guests to do **one more thing** with us instead of walking across the boardwalk to someone else.

That's the reality of operating on a boardwalk with no gates. Guests can leave anytime. So loyalty has to create real value—not just coupons.

Tyler shares the edge cases that almost broke everything, why certain offers fell flat internally, and how years of foundational data work made that four-month sprint possible.

If you're thinking about loyalty for your operation, this is a practical playbook from someone who shipped it with real constraints.
