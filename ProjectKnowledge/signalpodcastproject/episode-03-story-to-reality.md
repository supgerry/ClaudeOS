## Strategic Interview Framework: The Four Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Authenticity Engine
**Focus**: How personal trauma becomes defensible business moat through genuine mission-driven brand building.

_Context: Both founders discovered slime during personal trauma - Karen after losing husband to suicide, Sara while caring for disabled family members_

**Key Questions**:
- "Can you walk us through the moment slime stopped being a toy and became a tool for healing? How did that transform into a business?"
- "Your mission is to 'Deliver Joy.' How do you measure the ROI of joy in an industry obsessed with per-caps and turnstile counts?"
- "From day one, you named it Sloomoo 'Institute,' not a 'museum' or 'playground.' What was the strategic thinking behind that choice?"

### Pillar 2: Digital-to-Physical Bridge  
**Focus**: The synthesis of digital community expertise and physical space design creating the ultimate real-world expression of a social media trend.

**Key Questions**:
- "The 'satisfying slime' video trend was born on social media. How did you translate that digital phenomenon into a physical experience?"
- "75% of your customer acquisition comes from organic social media. How do you balance creating analog experiences while optimizing for digital shareability?"
- "What was the playbook for bridging that digital-to-physical chasm?"
- "You launched just four months before COVID shut everything down. You not only survived but scaled rapidly. What was the single most important lesson that constraint taught you about your business model?"

### Pillar 3: The IP of Emotion
**Focus**: Building original brand universe around feelings vs. licensing existing franchises.

**Key Questions**:
- "Most attractions license massive franchises. You built an entire universe around a feeling. What's the playbook for creating IP from a concept like 'joy'?"
- "How does your 60+ scent library and multi-sensory design serve the brand narrative?"
- "You've created the 'Sloomooverse' with characters like Lumo. How do you build a fictional universe from an emotion?"

### Pillar 4: The ROI of Joy
**Focus**: Experience as retail conversion funnel - using immersion to drive high-margin product sales.

**Key Questions**:
- "Your 80/20 ticket/retail split suggests the experience is really a marketing funnel for product sales. How intentional is that design?"
- "Sara, you've said 'immersive experiences are the future of retail.' What does that mean for traditional operators?"
- "Every guest leaves with a custom slime they created. How does that extend the brand experience beyond the four walls?"

## Host-Specific Strategic Angles

### For John (CEO/Tech/Data Focus)
- **Scalability of emotion-based brand systems**: "How do you use data to refine the sensory experience and ensure consistency across locations?"
- **Long-term value of owned IP**: "What's the strategic and financial value of owning your IP outright versus licensing existing content?"
- **Technology hidden behind analog experiences**: "You're using complex engineering to create experiences that feel simple and tactile. How do you balance that?"

### For Tim (Operations/Guest Experience Focus)  
- **Managing experience + consumable product**: "What are the unique staffing, training, and supply chain complexities of managing both experience and consumable product?"
- **Investment trade-offs**: "Sara mentioned investing in what's 'better, different, special.' Can you give us a concrete example of saying 'no' to save resources for something truly special?"
- **Accessibility as competitive advantage**: "You're 100% wheelchair accessible with 10% neurodiverse workforce. How does inclusion become a business differentiator?"

## Key Statistics & Talking Points

**Financial Performance**:
- $5M revenue in first 4 months (2019 pop-up)
- $30M annual revenue (2023)

**Operational Innovation**:
- 10% of workforce identifies as neurodiverse
- Partnership with mental health organizations (NAMI, Sad Girls Club)

**Competitive Context**:
