**Youtube title:** Ep 8: Pricing Science, Walk-Up Revenue, and Why Attractions Undersell Themselves (And How to Stop)



## **Long-form (for blog/website, LinkedIn, newsletter)**

# **Episode 08: Pricing Science, Walk-Up Revenue, and Why Attractions Undersell Themselves with Harry Tomasides & Tom Chiarella of Digonex**

If you're not dynamically pricing your walk-up window, you're probably leaving money on the table.

In this episode of **Signal**, hosts [**John Pendergrast**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pendergrast-082820/) and [**Tim Samson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothysamson/) sit down with **Harry Tomasides**, Chief Revenue Officer, and **Tom Chiarella**, Chief Product & Technology Officer, at [**Digonex**](https://www.digonex.com/)—one of the industry's most established names in pricing science.

With a team of PhD economists who don't just run algorithms but provide human-supervised price recommendations, Digonex has spent over a decade helping attractions, performing arts venues, and live entertainment organizations rethink their approach to pricing. What makes their approach different? Operators can approve, reject, or override every recommendation. It's pricing science with a human touch.

Harry and Tom break down what dynamic pricing actually means (hint: it's not the same as rules-based pricing), why the walk-up window is chronically underpriced, and the biggest mindset shift attractions need to make: stop underselling yourselves.

**You’ll hear about:**

- What pricing science actually looks like in practice—from booking data to weather to price elasticity
- Why "rules-based pricing" isn't the same as dynamic pricing (and why that distinction matters)
- The walk-up pricing problem: why there's "no daylight" between online and gate pricing at most attractions
- How one client went from "we'll never charge $40" to comfortably pricing at $45—with no guest blowback
- Why attractions consistently undersell themselves compared to performing arts and live entertainment
- The role of AI in pricing: where it helps, and why human oversight still matters
- How OTA distribution fits into a dynamic pricing strategy—and why commercial agreements often get in the way

If your walk-up price is the same as your online price, you're not doing dynamic pricing.

You're doing dynamic discounting.

I made a confession on this episode: my daughter told me her generation feels "punished" by dynamic pricing.

She's thinking airlines and concert tickets. And honestly? I get it.

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-8-digonex-dynamic-pricing-science-attractions](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-8-digonex-dynamic-pricing-science-attractions)

But that conversation is exactly why I wanted to sit down with Harry Tomasides and Tom Chiarella from Digonex. Because the perception of dynamic pricing and the reality are two very different things.

Here's what stuck with me:

Dynamic pricing isn't just about raising prices. It's about making experiences more accessible at certain times—plan-ahead pricing that rewards people who book early. It's about smoothing out crowds so the guest experience is actually better. And it's about attractions finally realizing the value of what they're providing.

Tom made a point that hit home: "If there's one thing attractions could learn from performing arts, it's know the value of what you're providing and own it."

We also got into:

- Why "rules-based pricing" isn't the same as dynamic pricing
- The walk-up pricing problem most operators ignore
- Where AI helps—and where human oversight still matters
- How one client went from "we'll never charge $40" to comfortably at $45

I've been in this industry for almost 25 years. Ticket prices were stagnant for a decade before COVID. Now we're finally having real conversations about pricing—and I think that's a good thing.

**Copy:**

Here's a question I asked Harry and Tom from Digonex:

If you're nervous about dynamic pricing across all your channels—online, walk-up, OTAs—what's the first step?

🎙 **New episode** → [www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-8-digonex-dynamic-pricing-science-attractions](http://www.rocketrez.com/signal/episode-8-digonex-dynamic-pricing-science-attractions)

Harry's answer was practical: start by understanding what percentage of your business is actually coming from each channel. Sometimes operators are hyper-focused on solving an OTA problem that represents 5% of their revenue.

But the bigger insight from this conversation was about walk-up pricing.

Most attractions have "no daylight" between their online price and their gate price. Harry called it what it is: dynamic discounting, not dynamic pricing. If your algorithm is only lowering prices from a fixed ceiling, you're leaving money on the table.

One client went from "we'll never charge $40" to comfortably pricing at $45—with no blowback. The key? Guests had other options to get a lower price if they planned ahead.

Tom and Harry also got into:

- The difference between rules-based and true dynamic pricing
- Why attractions consistently undersell compared to performing arts
- Where AI fits—and why human oversight still matters
- How to get dynamic pricing working across OTAs

If you're thinking about pricing for next season, this is a practical conversation from two people who've been doing this for a long time.
