## Guest Introduction

"Today we’re joined by Evan Reece, an entrepreneur whose career has been defined by one big idea: pricing isn’t just about numbers — it’s about shaping behavior.

Evan is best known for pioneering real-time pricing strategies in industries like ski resorts, (you might have heard of Liftopia/Catalate), where he showed operators how to balance demand, value perception, and guest satisfaction. But what makes Evan’s perspective so valuable for attractions is that he’s not just a ‘pricing guy’ — he’s a behavior strategist. He’s spent years helping organizations rethink the way they set prices, not to punish demand, but to create the patterns they want to see in guest behavior.

And here's what's interesting: He doesn't start with fancy algorithms. He starts with what he calls 'pricing hygiene' – the unsexy but critical work of making sure your prices are consistent across every channel where your tickets are sold. Because the truth is: you can have the most sophisticated dynamic pricing on your website, but if you have 150 other websites selling your tickets at different prices, you're undermining your entire strategy.

Today, Evan runs his own advisory practice and is also building new technology ventures aimed at shifting consumer behavior in other industries. For our audience, his insights come at a perfect moment: attractions everywhere are rethinking their 2026 pricing models right now.

Evan, welcome to Signal."

## Part 1: Pricing Hygiene Comes First (8–10 minutes)

**John**: “Evan, you’ve said pricing hygiene matters more than dynamic pricing itself. What does bad hygiene look like in practice for an attraction operator?”

**Tim**: "You mentioned you once found five different websites undercutting a client's own pricing in just eight minutes of browsing. How does an attraction even begin to get control of that ecosystem?"

**John** (Business Focus): "The hotel industry has been doing cross-channel price management for decades. What structural differences make this harder in attractions?”

**Tim** (Operational Reality): "Let's get practical. An attraction has contracts with Groupon, they're on third-party booking sites, they have season pass holders, group sales – how do you coordinate pricing across all those channels without breaking existing agreements?"

## Part 2: Pricing as Behavior Design (8–10 minutes) 


**John**: "You've said that pricing should be about creating the patterns you want to see and shaping behavior, not just maximizing demand. What does that look like in practice for an attraction operator?"

**Tim**: "Everyone thinks dynamic pricing means surge pricing during peak times. You advocate for pricing as incentive rather than punishment. How do you use pricing to actually improve the guest experience?"

**John** (Metrics): “You’ve mentioned there’s one metric most operators overlook. What is it — and why does it matter more than the daily ticket price?”

**Tim** (Seasonal Reality): "Most attractions are dealing with extreme seasonality – dead winter, crazy summer, where 70% of your revenue comes in 12 weeks. How do you apply these pricing strategies in highly seasonal businesses?"


---

## Part 3: Organizational Buy-In (8-10 minutes)

**Tim** (Team Dynamics): "Changing pricing strategy isn't just about algorithms – it's about getting your team to buy in. How do you win over sales teams used to discounting or ops teams worried about guest complaints?"

**John** (Executive Leadership): "From a leadership perspective, how do you build confidence in pricing changes when everyone's afraid of alienating customers?"

**Tim** (Front-Line Implementation): "Your pricing strategy is only as good as your staff explaining it. How should operators prepare front-line teams to handle tough guest questions?”

**John** (Measurement and Optimization): "What metrics should operators be tracking beyond just revenue per visitor? How do you know if your pricing strategy is actually working?"

**Tim**: "AI is creeping into pricing. Where do you see real potential — and where should operators be cautious?"


---

## Part 4: The Pricing Maturity Curve  (8-10 minutes)


**John** (Business Scalability): "You mentioned there isn't necessarily a sequential progression through pricing maturity stages. For an operator just getting started, where should they focus first? What's the highest-impact, lowest-risk move?"

**Tim** (Real-World Application): "Let's say I'm running a mid-sized attraction setting pricing for next season right now. Walk me through your framework – what questions am I asking, what data am I looking at?"

**John** (Competitive Advantage): "Revenue management is becoming table stakes in hospitality. Do you see pricing sophistication becoming a competitive requirement in attractions, or is there still a first-mover advantage?"

**Tim** (Industry Evolution): "Coming from hotels to attractions, what surprises you most about how our industry approaches pricing? What obvious opportunities are we missing?"

## Behind the Scenes Segment (5-7 minutes)

### Practical Implementation

**Tim** (Operational Tactics): "What's your first question when you're evaluating an attraction's pricing readiness? What immediately tells you whether they're ready for more sophisticated strategies?"

**John** (Technology Requirements): "What's the minimum viable tech stack for an attraction that wants to implement strategic pricing? What should they invest in first versus what can wait?"

**Tim** (Common Pitfalls): "What's the most common pricing mistake you see attractions make that they don't even realize is undermining their revenue?"

**John** (Industry Comparison): "Hotels compete with online travel agencies daily on pricing. Who are attractions really competing with on price, and are they thinking about competition correctly?"

### Key Takeaways

**John**: "Evan, you're building career management software while consulting on pricing strategy. How do those experiences inform each other? What patterns do you see across industries about organizational change?"

**Tim**: "For operators listening who know their pricing needs work but feel overwhelmed, what's the one thing they should start doing differently next week?"

**John**: "Looking ahead, how do you see pricing strategy evolving in attractions? What should operators be preparing for?"

**Themes we explored today:**
1. Why pricing hygiene comes before dynamic pricing
2. How lessons from hotels and airlines can be adapted — not copied
