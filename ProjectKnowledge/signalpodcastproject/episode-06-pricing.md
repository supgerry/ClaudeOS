## Guest Introduction

"Today we’re joined by Evan Reece, an entrepreneur whose career has been defined by one big idea: pricing isn’t just about numbers — it’s about shaping behavior.

Evan is best known for pioneering real-time pricing strategies in industries like ski resorts, where he showed operators how to balance demand, value perception, and guest satisfaction. But what makes Evan’s perspective so valuable for attractions is that he’s not just a ‘pricing guy’ — he’s a behavior strategist. He’s spent years helping organizations rethink the way they set prices, not to punish demand, but to create the patterns they want to see in guest behavior.

And here's what's also interesting about Evan's approach: He doesn't start with dynamic pricing algorithms or fancy software. He starts with what he calls 'pricing hygiene' – the unsexy but critical work of making sure your prices are consistent across every channel where your tickets are sold.

Because here's the reality he's uncovered: you can have the most sophisticated dynamic pricing on your website, but if you have 150 other websites selling your tickets at different prices, you're actually undermining your entire strategy.

Today, Evan runs his own advisory practice and is also building new technology ventures aimed at shifting consumer behavior in other industries. For our audience, his insights come at a perfect moment: attractions everywhere are rethinking their 2026 pricing models right now.

Evan, welcome to Signal."

## Part 1: The Pricing Hygiene Foundation (8-10 minutes)

### Opening Questions

**John**: "Evan, you have this concept of 'pricing hygiene' that you say is more important than dynamic pricing itself. Can you paint us a picture of what bad pricing hygiene looks like for a typical attraction operator?"

**Tim**: "You mentioned finding five different instances of websites undercutting a client's own pricing in just eight minutes of browsing. From an operational standpoint, how does an attraction even begin to get control of that ecosystem?"

**John** (Business Strategy Focus): "The hotel industry has been doing cross-channel price management for decades. What structural differences make this harder for attractions, and how do those differences change the strategic approach?"

**Tim** (Operational Reality): "Let's get practical. An attraction has contracts with Groupon, they're on third-party booking sites, they have season pass holders, group sales – how do you coordinate pricing across all those channels without breaking existing agreements?"

## Part 2: Beyond Surge Pricing - Strategic Behavior Design (8-10 minutes)

### Core Questions

**John** (Strategic Framework): "You've said that pricing should be about creating the patterns you want to see, not just taking advantage of demand spikes. What does that philosophy look like in practice for an attraction operator?"

**Tim** (Guest Experience Focus): "Everyone thinks dynamic pricing means surge pricing during peak times. You advocate for pricing as incentive rather than punishment. How do you use pricing to actually improve the guest experience?"

**John** (Technology Integration): "What's the role of AI and automation in pricing decisions? You mentioned earlier that operators should be cautious about just trusting AI – what should they be watching for?"

**Tim** (Seasonal Reality): "Most attractions are dealing with extreme seasonality – dead winter, crazy summer. How do you apply these pricing strategies when 70% of your revenue comes in 12 weeks?"

---

## Part 3: Organizational Change Management (8-10 minutes)

### Strategic Questions

**Tim** (Team Dynamics): "Changing pricing strategy isn't just about algorithms – it's about getting your team to buy in. What's your approach when you walk into an organization where the sales team is used to discounting everything?"

**John** (Executive Leadership): "From a leadership perspective, how do you build organizational confidence in dynamic pricing when everyone's afraid of alienating customers? What's the change management process?"

**Tim** (Front-Line Implementation): "Your pricing strategy is only as good as your front-line team's ability to explain it to confused guests. How do you train staff to handle pricing questions confidently?"

**John** (Measurement and Optimization): "What metrics should operators be tracking beyond just revenue per visitor? How do you know if your pricing strategy is actually working?"

---

## Part 4: The Maturity Curve in Action (8-10 minutes)

### Implementation Questions

**John** (Business Scalability): "You mentioned there isn't necessarily a sequential progression through pricing maturity stages. For an operator just getting started, where should they focus first? What's the highest-impact, lowest-risk move?"

**Tim** (Real-World Application): "Let's say I'm running a mid-sized attraction setting pricing for next season right now. Walk me through your framework – what questions am I asking, what data am I looking at?"

**John** (Competitive Advantage): "Revenue management is becoming table stakes in hospitality. Do you see pricing sophistication becoming a competitive requirement in attractions, or is there still a first-mover advantage?"

**Tim** (Industry Evolution): "Coming from hotels to attractions, what surprises you most about how our industry approaches pricing? What obvious opportunities are we missing?"

## Behind the Scenes Segment (5-7 minutes)

### Practical Implementation

**Tim** (Operational Tactics): "What's your first question when you're evaluating an attraction's pricing readiness? What immediately tells you whether they're ready for more sophisticated strategies?"

**John** (Technology Requirements): "What's the minimum viable tech stack for an attraction that wants to implement strategic pricing? What should they invest in first versus what can wait?"

**Tim** (Common Pitfalls): "What's the most common pricing mistake you see attractions make that they don't even realize is undermining their revenue?"

**John** (Industry Comparison): "Hotels compete with online travel agencies daily on pricing. Who are attractions really competing with on price, and are they thinking about competition correctly?"
