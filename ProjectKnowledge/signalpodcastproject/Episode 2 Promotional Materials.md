### #1: The Experience Economy, Tech‚Äôs Role, and the Biggest Blind Spot in Attractions

In this debut episode of **Signal**, hosts [John Pendergrast](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pendergrast-082820/) and [Tim Samson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothysamson/) set the stage for what this podcast is all about: candid, forward-looking conversations for leaders in the attractions industry.

John and Tim share their unconventional journeys‚Äîfrom roller coasters at Cedar Point to early software builds for reservation systems‚Äîand why operators today need more spaces to talk openly about the challenges shaping guest experiences.

This conversation covers four key industry trends and digs into why technology must serve guests first, why standardization matters, and where operators are most at risk of falling behind.

**What you‚Äôll learn in this episode:**

- Why the _experience economy_ isn‚Äôt just maturing‚Äîit‚Äôs evolving
- Where tech adds value vs. where it breaks immersion
- How high demand is colliding with operational headwinds (and what VIP pricing means for access)

- The industry‚Äôs biggest blind spot: misalignment between guest-first business models and order-first technology
