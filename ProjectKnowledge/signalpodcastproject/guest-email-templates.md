## Template 1: Pre-Call Scheduling (Reply to Existing Thread)

**Subject**: Re: [Original Subject]  
**Use Case**: When replying to existing guest confirmation

```
Hi [Guest Name],
 
We're thrilled to have you on Signal! Thanks again for joining us.
 
I'd love to set up a quick 15–30 minute pre-call to walk through the episode theme, chat through key stories or takeaways you'd like to share, and confirm logistics (recording setup, timing, etc.). You can book a time that works best for you using this link:

https://calendly.com/signal-rocketrez/30min

Additionally, to ensure we capture the best audio and video quality, we will be sending you a professional microphone and webcam. Could you please reply with your preferred shipping address?
 
Once we've confirmed a recording time and the mics are on the way, I'll send over a short prep doc with the rough episode structure.
 
We look forward to collaborating with you.
 
Cheers,
Gerry
