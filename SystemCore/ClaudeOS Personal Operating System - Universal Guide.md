# System Architecture Overview

### ClaudeOS Core Philosophy

ClaudeOS is a personal AI operating system that transforms individual Claude projects from isolated tools into an integrated intelligence network with automatic document routing and project boundary management. Each project maintains its specialized focus while contributing to and benefiting from the broader system intelligence.

### Three-Document Architecture with Local File Management

Every Claude project in the ClaudeOS ecosystem follows the same startup protocol:

**Universal Documents (Shared Across All Projects):**
1. **"ClaudeOS Personal Operating System - Universal Guide"** (this document)
2. **"Claude Project Tool Usage Guide - Local File Operations"**

**Project-Specific Documents:**
3. **"[Project Name] - Strategic Instructions"** (unique to each project)
4. **"[Project Name] - Project Metadata"** (REQUIRED: contains routing information)

### System Benefits with Local File Management

- **Operational Consistency**: All projects follow same protocols with automatic routing
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Cross-project intelligence and status visibility
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Update universal docs once, affects all projects
- **Strategic Coordination**: Business initiatives remain aligned with proper boundaries
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new projects with automatic folder creation
- **Version Control**: Git integration for change tracking and collaboration
- **Portability**: No external dependencies or cloud services required

---

## CRITICAL SYSTEM CORE ACCESS CONTROL

### System Core Repository Structure

- **System Core (SystemCore folder) contains:**
  - ClaudeOS Personal Operating System - Universal Guide (this document)
  - Claude Project Tool Usage Guide - Local File Operations
  - Other universal documents used across ALL projects

### Access Control Hierarchy

**System Owner: Geraldine Lee**
- **Ultimate Authority**: All System Core modifications require explicit approval
- **System Architecture Decisions**: Final authority on ClaudeOS evolution and changes
- **Emergency Override**: Can authorize immediate System Core updates during critical situations

**ClaudeOS Management Project: LIMITED Administrative Authority**
- **Recommendation Authority**: Can propose System Core updates based on operational needs
- **Conditional Write Access**: Can update System Core files ONLY with explicit user approval
- **Impact Assessment**: Must evaluate effects on all projects before proposing changes
- **Implementation Authority**: Can execute approved System Core modifications
- **Change Documentation**: Must maintain version control and communicate updates

**All Other ClaudeOS Projects: READ-ONLY ACCESS**
- ❌ **NO AUTHORITY** to update System Core files under any circumstances
- ✅ **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** with all System Core protocols and procedures
- ✅ **Suggestion Channel**: Can recommend improvements through ClaudeOS Management
- ✅ **Focus Boundary**: Must limit document updates to their own project folders only

### System Core Update Protocol

**For ClaudeOS Management Project:**
1. **Assess Need**: Identify specific operational requirement or system improvement
2. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate effect on all active projects and system stability
3. **Request Approval**: Present recommendation to Geraldine Lee with clear justification
4. **Await Explicit Authorization**: No System Core updates without explicit "yes" command
5. **Implement Carefully**: Execute approved changes with proper version control
6. **Communicate Changes**: Notify all projects of System Core updates through status reports
7. **Monitor Results**: Track system-wide impact and address any issues immediately

**For All Other Projects:**
- **NEVER attempt System Core updates** - this will cause system instability
- **Route all System Core suggestions** through ClaudeOS Management project
- **Focus on project-specific documents** within designated project folders
- **Report System Core issues** to ClaudeOS Management for evaluation

### System Core Security Rationale

Why These Restrictions Are Critical:

- **System Stability**: Universal documents affect ALL projects simultaneously
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Prevents conflicting protocols across the ecosystem
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures all changes are properly tested and documented
- **Strategic Alignment**: Maintains coherent system architecture and evolution
- **Error Prevention**: Avoids cascade failures from poorly implemented changes

## Universal Startup Protocol

### Standard Claude Project Instructions Field

Your instructions are located in three documents in project knowledge:      
1. Read "[Project Name] - Strategic Instructions"       
2. Read "Claude Project Tool Usage Guide - Local File Operations"      
3. Read "ClaudeOS Personal Operating System - Universal Guide"      

Fully comprehend all three documents before any response.

### Mandatory Startup Sequence

Every new chat in any ClaudeOS project MUST:

1. **Read System Documentation** - Understand ClaudeOS protocols and project routing
2. **Read Tool Documentation** - Understand local file management workflows with project folders
3. **Read Project Instructions** - Understand project-specific context and folder name
4. **Verify Cross-Project Status** - Check relevant status documents
5. **Confirm Operational Readiness** - Acknowledge understanding before proceeding

### Error Prevention Protocol

- Never proceed without reading all three foundation documents
- Always verify document titles exactly before file operations
- Always use correct project folder paths when creating documents
- Create project folders before creating documents for new projects
- Maintain separation between strategic thinking and file management mechanics
- Update status documents when significant developments occur
- NEVER attempt System Core file updates (except ClaudeOS Management with approval)

---

## CRITICAL DOCUMENT UPDATE SAFETY PROTOCOL

### Before Updating ANY Document - MANDATORY CHECK:

1. **Verify Document is in Project Knowledge** - Check if document title exists in THIS project's knowledge base
2. **Check System Core Status** - If document is in System Core, confirm authorization level
3. **If Document is NOT in Project Knowledge** = READ ONLY ACCESS (never update)
4. **If Document IS in Project Knowledge** = Safe to update within project folder
5. **If Document is System Core** = Only ClaudeOS Management with explicit approval
6. **When in Doubt** = Ask user for explicit permission before any document updates

### Cross-Project Document Access Rules

- **READ ACCESS**: All projects can read accessible documents for reference
- **WRITE ACCESS**: Projects can ONLY update documents in their own project folder
- **SYSTEM CORE ACCESS**: Only ClaudeOS Management with explicit user approval
- **PROJECT ROUTING**: Documents are automatically created in correct project directories
- **FOLDER CREATION**: New project folders created through standard file operations
- **USER OVERRIDE**: User can explicitly command cross-project operations when needed

### Document Security Examples

**✅ SAFE TO UPDATE:**
- "[Project Name] - Strategic Instructions" (if in current project knowledge)
- "[Project Name] Project Status Report" (if in current project knowledge)

**⚠️ RESTRICTED ACCESS:**
- System Core documents (ClaudeOS Management only, with approval)

**❌ READ ONLY ACCESS:**
- Documents from other projects not in current project knowledge
- Shared documents accessible but not designated as project-specific
- System Core documents (for all projects except ClaudeOS Management)

## Project Folder Routing System

### ClaudeOS Directory Structure

```
ClaudeOS/    
├── ProjectKnowledge/    
│   ├── [project1folder]/          # Your Project 1 documents    
│   ├── [project2folder]/          # Your Project 2 documents      
│   ├── [project3folder]/          # Your Project 3 documents    
│   ├── claudeosmanagement/        # ClaudeOS Management project documents  
│   └── [newfolder]/               # New projects (created via mkdir)    
├── SystemCore/                    # UNIVERSAL DOCUMENTS - RESTRICTED ACCESS  
│   ├── universal-guide.md
│   ├── tool-usage-guide.md
│   └── templates/
```

### Project Folder Naming Convention

**Format**: [projectname][type] (no spaces, lowercase)

**Examples:**
- businessprojectadvisory (Business Advisory Project)
- contentcreationhub (Content Creation Project)
- clientproject[name] (Client projects)
- claudeosmanagement (ClaudeOS Management)

### How Local File Routing Works

1. Create project directory with mkdir in ClaudeOS/ProjectKnowledge
2. Claude project creates documents with correct file paths
3. File operations use direct file system paths
4. Document boundaries maintained through folder structure
5. Project boundaries maintained through file path routing

### Project Identity Requirements

Each project must know its own folder name:

- Reference project metadata document: "[Project Name] - Project Metadata"
- Include folder name in project-specific strategic instructions
- Use consistent naming across all project references

---

## Local File Management Integration

### File Operations and Location

- **Location**: ClaudeOS folder structure on local file system
- **Available Operations**:
  - Create project folders (mkdir)
  - Create documents (Write tool)
  - Update documents (Edit tool)
  - Read documents (Read tool)

### Local File Management Standardization

All ClaudeOS projects use the same file operations with identical workflows:

- **mkdir** - New project folder creation in ProjectKnowledge directory
- **Write** - New document creation with project routing
- **Edit** - Document content management with exact path matching

### File Operation Consistency

- **Reference Authority**: Always consult "Claude Project Tool Usage Guide - Local File Operations"
- **Workflow Compliance**: Follow exact step-by-step procedures with project folders
- **Error Prevention**: Verify document paths and use correct project folder names
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain markdown formatting and proper structure
- **System Core Respect**: Never attempt System Core updates without proper authorization

### Project Routing Parameters

**For new project creation:**
```
mkdir ClaudeOS/ProjectKnowledge/[project_folder_name]
```

**For document creation:**
```
Write file_path: ClaudeOS/ProjectKnowledge/[project_folder_name]/[document_name].md
```

**Example Project Folders:**
- businessadvisoryproject - Business advisory initiative
- contentcreationhub - Content and marketing project
- clientprojectabc - Client project ABC
- claudeosmanagement - ClaudeOS Management project

### Version Control Integration

- Local git repository for change tracking
- All projects automatically inherit improvements through git updates
- New capabilities are documented once and available system-wide
- Troubleshooting solutions benefit entire system through shared documentation
